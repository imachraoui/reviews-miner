0;total bill for this horrible service? over $8gs;;;;
1;these crooks actually had the nerve to charge us $69 for 3 pills;;;;
2;i checked online the pills can be had for 19 cents each! avoid hospital ers at all costs;;;;
3;i *adore* travis at the hard rock's new kelly cardenas salon!  i'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service;;;;
4;however travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!;;;;
5;travis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a vegas-worthy rockstar outfit;;;;
6;next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room;;;;
7;travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure;;;;
8;that was superb!  then starts the glorious blowout;;;;
9;where not one not two but three people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen;;;;
10;the team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement;;;;
11;it was so much fun to be there!;;;;
12;next travis started with the flat iron;;;;
13;the way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a texas pagent girl was admirable;;;;
14;it's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that i've had happen before with less skilled stylists;;;;
15;at the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific;;;;
16;the only thing better?  that this awesome blowout lasted for days!;;;;
17;travis i will see you every single time i'm out in vegas;;;;
18;you make me feel beauuuutiful!;;;;
19;i have to say that this office really has it together they are so organized and friendly!  dr;;;;
20;phillipp is a great dentist very friendly and professional;;;;
21;the dental assistants that helped in my procedure were amazing jewel and bailey helped me to feel comfortable!  i don't have dental insurance but they have this insurance through their office you can purchase for $80 something a year and this gave me 25% off all of my dental work plus they helped me get signed up for care credit which i knew nothing about before this visit!  i highly recommend this office for the nice synergy the whole office has!;;;;
22;went in for a lunch;;;;
23;steak sandwich was delicious and the caesar salad had an absolutely delicious dressing with a perfect amount of dressing and distributed perfectly across each leaf;;;;
24;i know i'm going on about the salad;;;;
25;but it was perfect;;;;
26;drink prices were pretty good;;;;
27;the server dawn was friendly and accommodating;;;;
28;very happy with her;;;;
29;in summation a great pub experience;;;;
30;would go again!;;;;
31;today was my second out of three sessions i had paid for;;;;
32;although my first session went well i could tell meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female;;;;
33;however i returned because she did my teeth fine and i was pleased with the results;;;;
34;when i went in today i was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen;;;;
35;my appointment started out well although being a person who is in the service industry i always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives;;;;
36;unbothered by those signs i waited my turn;;;;
37;she checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if i was ok;;;;
38;she attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions as well as the other men and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if i had any irritation;;;;
39;half way through another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby;;;;
40;while she admits timers must be reset half way through the process she reset my boyfriends left rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in redeem his deal get set and gave his timer done before me then left and at this point my time was at 10 minutes;;;;
41;so she should have reset it 5 minutes ago according to her;;;;
42;while i sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums i watched the time until the lamp shut off;;;;
43;not only had she reset two others explained deals to other guest but she never once checked on my time;;;;
44;when my light turned off i released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state assuming i was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45 because she had yet to come in;;;;
45;at this point the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now but it began to burn my lips;;;;
46;i began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic;;;;
47;i was in so much pain that by the time she entered the room i was already out of my chair;;;;
48;she finally then acknowledged me and asked if she could put vitamin e on my gum burn (pictured below);;;;
49;at this point she has treated two other gums burns while neglecting me and i was so irritated that i had to suffer all i wanted was to leave;;;;
50;while i waited for my boyfriend she kept harassing me about the issue;;;;
51;"saying ""well burns come with teeth whitening";;;;
52;""" while i totally agree and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time so i could let her know";;;;
53;not only did she never check on my physical health she couldn't even take two seconds to reset the timer which she even admitted to me;;;;
54;her accuse was that she was coming in to do it but i had the light off for a solid two minutes before i couldn't stand the pain;;;;
55;she admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all;;;;
56;her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well simply because i wanted to leave after the way i was treated;;;;
57;i also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today due to the neglect and the fact i won't be returning for my last she had failed to do that;;;;
58;she was even screaming from the door and continued to until my boyfriend and i were down the steps;;;;
59;"i have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman's behavior who claims to be in the business for ""10 years";;;;
60;""" admit your wrongs but don't make your guest feel unwelcome because you can't do you job properly";;;;
61;i'll be the first to admit that i was not excited about going to la tavolta;;;;
62;being a food snob when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner i looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced;;;;
63;im also not big on ordering pasta when i go out;;;;
64;alas i was outnumbered;;;;
65;thank goodness! i ordered the sea bass special;;;;
66;it was to die for;;;;
67;cooked perfectly seasoned perfectly perfect portion;;;;
68;i can not say enough good things about this dish;;;;
69;"when the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said "" doesn't she (the chef) do an incredible job?"" she does";;;;
70;my hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his;;;;
71;"i heard ""mmmm this is so good"" from all around the table";;;;
72;our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant;;;;
73;service was very slow and the place was packed but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn't seem to bother anyone;;;;
74;so-;;;;
75;do order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers;;;;
76;leave out the mussels;;;;
77;if they have the sea bass special i highly recommend it;;;;
78;the chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big;;;;
79;the chicken romano was a bit bland;;;;
80;the house salads were teeny;;;;
81;do make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food;;;;
82;go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud;;;;
83;don't go with a date unless you're fighting and don't feel like hearing anything they have to say;;;;
84;ask to sit in the side room if it's available;;;;
85;tracy dessert had a big name in hong kong and the one in first markham place has been here for many years now!;;;;
86;came in for some chinese dessert and i must say their selection has increased tremendously over the years;;;;
87;i might as well add that the price has also increased tremendously as well;;;;
88;the waitress gave us tea which i could taste had red date in it;;;;
89;fancy!;;;;
90;a simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5;;;;
91;25 or something;;;;
92;basically all the desserts were more than $5;;;;
93;that's crazy! i can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl it would probably cost like $0;;;;
94;a few years ago i think i can still get it for like $3-$4 which is more reasonable but wow more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert;;;;
95;though i must say it is tracy dessert and they are a little more on the expensive side;;;;
96;i also saw other items on the menu like fish balls chicken wings shaved ice;;;;
97;my friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it!;;;;
98;i'm also surprised how many people come to tracy dessert after work;;;;
99;we came on a sunday and the tables were always filled;;;;
100;i think the amount of tables they had were just perfect because no one really waited for seats for a long time but the tables kept filling up once a table was finished;;;;
101;this place has gone down hill;;;;
102;clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality;;;;
103;many of the reviews were written before the menu changed;;;;
104;i've been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill;;;;
105;the service is slow & my salad which was $15 was as bad as it gets;;;;
106;it's just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options;;;;
107;i was really looking forward to visiting after having some of their beers;;;;
108;"the ""man o'war"" quickly became my favorite dipa";;;;
109;the rusulka vanilla stout is a good thick sweet stout;;;;
110;and the ironclad is a top notch ipa;;;;
111;the only big miss on their beers i've had is the big chuck barleywine;;;;
112;it could probably benefit greatly with age but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol;;;;
113;nonetheless i had enough to convince me that the other beers i hadn't had from them would be top notch;;;;
114;and they are!;;;;
115;the reason for the 2 stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers they obviously know their craft well!;;;;
116;the servers are great and friendly;;;;
117;but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be;;;;
118;in fact after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table i was finally able to track down someone i guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there!;;;;
119;after another 5+ mins the gm finally stopped over to take our drink order;;;;
120;the smugness of this guy was amazing;;;;
121;the thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head;;;;
122;this is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us;;;;
123;who didn't seem very pleased when leaving;;;;
124;the toast & cheese was good but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing;;;;
125;it's a giant best buy with 66 registers;;;;
126;i don't get it;;;;
127;what's the big deal about this place??;;;;
128;like walking back in time every saturday morning my sister and i was in a bowling league and after we were done we'd spend a few quarters playing the pin ball machines until our mother came to pick us up;;;;
129;"my sister was daring and play the machines hard she was afraid of that ""tilt"" showing up and freezing the game";;;;
130;i on the other hand was a bit more gentler and wanted to make sure i got my quarter's worth;;;;
131;this place has rows and rows of machines some are really old and some are more of a mid 80's theme;;;;
132;there is even a ms pac man!  it was fun to spend an afternoon playing the machines and remembering all the fun of my early teen years;;;;
133;walked in around 4 on a friday afternoon we sat at a table just off the bar and walked out after 5 min or so;;;;
134;don't even think they realized we walked in;;;;
135;however everyone at the bar noticed we walked in!!! service was non existent at best;;;;
136;not a good way for a new business to start out;;;;
137;oh well the location they are at has been about 5 different things over the past several years so they will just be added to the list;;;;
138;smdh!!!;;;;
139;wow;;;;
140;so surprised at the one and two star reviews!  we started with the most tender calamari;;;;
141;although the marinara sauce was a bit bland but a touch of salt made it just right;;;;
142;my husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender;;;;
143;the mashed potatoes were perfect;;;;
144;i had the salmon diablo which was also delicious;;;;
145;our salad was beautiful! dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount;;;;
146;we ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu;;;;
147;our server matt was right on!! very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu;;;;
148;our appetizer salad and entrees were timed perfectly;;;;
149;i love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while i was still eating it! no problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably;;;;
150;i wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal;;;;
151;a wonderful atmosphere;;;;
152;so relaxing;;;;
153;the chairs are super comfortable too!!! we will certainly be back;;;;
154;give it a try;;;;
155;don't  always go by the reviews;;;;
156;a bottle of riesling calamari app two delicious entrees and dessert for $92!;;;;
157;well with it;;;;
158;michael from red carpet vip is amazing ! i reached out because i needed help planning my soon to be sister in law's bachelorette;;;;
159;it was a group of 10 girls so i was a little overwhelmed but michael saved the day! everything was super smooth and easy! we got good deals and had the best time ever! we booked hotel and a bachelorette package for a great price;;;;
160;i have saved contact info because i will for sure reach out again on next vegas trip!!!;;;;
161;i cannot believe how things have changed in 3 years;;;;
162;i picked up duck congee sometime in the winter when my hubby was sick;;;;
163;i was very disappointed because the ginger fish sauce tasted like it had gone bad (it should never be bitter);;;;
164;today my hubby wanted to eat there since he was craving the duck congee and most places don't serve the duck & coleslaw side;;;;
165;we waited about 10 minutes to get our menu;;;;
166;after we placed our orders we waited another 5 minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu;;;;
167;i could go on with the details but the gist of the story is they were understaffed or the staff was slow;;;;
168;the worst part of it was that the service;;;;
169;the servers make us feel bad for asking for anything (like when they took our order);;;;
170;we had arrived and placed our order before another couple bside us at least 10 minutes ahead but somehow this couple received their pho before mine;;;;
171;they were almost done eating their pho before mine came out;;;;
172;you can't really find anything wrong with this place the pastas and pizzas are both amazing and high quality the price is very reasonable the owner and the staff are very friendly if you're in downtown check this place out a lot of people think just because it's downtown there are lots of options around but that's not always the case as there is also a lot of poor quality food in downtown as well;;;;
173;great lunch today;;;;
174;staff was very helpful in assisting with selections and knowledgeable on the ingredients;;;;
175;we enjoyed the bbq chicken with tika masala sauce and really good naan bread;;;;
176;the biryani with chicken was also yummy! fun to see the food being prepared in the tandoori ovens;;;;
177;great addition to the fast casual scene in cleveland;;;;
178;i love chinese food and i love mexican food;;;;
179;what can go wrong? a couple of things;;;;
180;"first things first this place is more of a ""rice bowl"" kind of place";;;;
181;i thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats;;;;
182;the ordering was a little confusing at first but one of the employees helped us out and i got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk);;;;
183;i also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side;;;;
184;i'm gonna admit this place looks kinda dirty;;;;
185;"i don't think arizona uses those health department letter grade system like california does but if i were to just judge by how it looked inside i'd give it a ""c"" grade lol";;;;
186;we waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food;;;;
187;we took it to go and ate at our hotel room;;;;
188;mmmm;;;;
189;the food was just alright;;;;
190;the jade chicken was nothing special;;;;
191;it tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant;;;;
192;the hengrenade chicken although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken was still pretty spicy for me;;;;
193;just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy;;;;
194;if you aren't sure ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering but it was way too spicy for me;;;;
195;the jade chicken quesadilla was decent but nothing special;;;;
196;just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese;;;;
197;a friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of mcdonald's apple pie;;;;
198;if you order the burrito be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs but he said it was tasty;;;;
199;they provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent again nothing special;;;;
200;not gonna lie the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside;;;;
201;i used the bathroom like 5 times;;;;
202;i don't recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day;;;;
203;we've been a huge slim's fan since they opened one up in texas about two years ago when we used to live there;;;;
204;this place never disappoints;;;;
205;they even have great salads and grilled chicken;;;;
206;plus they have fresh brewed sweet tea it's the best!;;;;
207;good selection of classes of beers and mains;;;;
208;i've been here twice;;;;
209;first time i had the fried chicken;;;;
210;it was delicious but be warned extremely salty;;;;
211;i couldn't even finish the last piece of chicken after experiencing a salt overload;;;;
212;second time we came on a wednesday;;;;
213;we didn't know it was bbq night where they have a completely different menu and don't offer anything from their original vegetarian-friendly menu;;;;
214;this menu has one vegetarian-friendly option - an eggplant sandwich;;;;
215;the vegetarian in my party said it was awful;;;;
216;also on bbq night you choose 2 sides;;;;
217;except they were out of all their sides except 2 - fries and potato salad;;;;
218;i can't say i was thrilled to have carb heavy sides with my carb heavy main;;;;
219;how do you run out of sides so early in the evening?;;;;
220;service not so great;;;;
221;i'd avoid coming here on wednesdays;;;;
222;our family loves the food here;;;;
223;quick friendly delicious and a great restaurant to take kids to;;;;
224;5 stars!;;;;
225;if you are looking for the best pierogies in pittsburgh this is your place;;;;
226;there are a few small tables outside but most of the business is carry out;;;;
227;pierogies plus wins best pierogies every year;;;;
228;why? because the owner is from poland and she is making the real deal pierogies;;;;
229;the best part is that they are hand pinched by a group of older polish and hungarian women;;;;
230;the biggest seller is potato and cheese but they sell many flavors;;;;
231;they are like plump pillows of softness;;;;
232;you can buy them buy the dozen;;;;
233;you can get them cold to take home and freeze or warm and ready to eat;;;;
234;the warm ones are served with butter and onions;;;;
235;it's definitely a comfort food;;;;
236;the best part is that they ship internationally;;;;
237;yes they are that good;;;;
238;the food is always good and the prices are reasonable;;;;
239;although it's not exactly a restaurant -- more like a snack bar limited menu and you walk up to the counter place your order wait a minute or so for them to prepare your order and pay the cashier then search for a table;;;;
240;kind of like a sandwich shop;;;;
241;still a much better choice for value than the other hotel deli's on the strip;;;;
242;pick any meat on the planet and the chef will make a mexican style dish with amazing flavor! wow fish and lamb tacos to die for;;;;
243;drinks are great as well;;;;
244;great food great service;;;;
245;obviously fried chicken isn't the healthiest food on earth but once a month i get that craving for good fried chicken;;;;
246;their chicken is great doesn't seem too fatty and their sides are excellent too;;;;
247;plumbsmart provided superior service from beginning to end;;;;
248;they were able to repair a badly damaged sewer pipe with only one day's notice;;;;
249;i was particularly pleased with their attention to care when cleaning up the landscape after the job was completed;;;;
250;their competitive pricing and excellent service make them my first stop for all future plumbing needs;;;;
251;thank you to wayne and the whole team!;;;;
252;#NAME?;;;;
253;unfortunately i must recommend not to conduct any business with fast fix jewelry and watch repairs;;;;
254;the staff is completely unprofessional and i have never been treated so rudely in my life;;;;
255;"i was actually shocked and walked away thinking ""wow how do those people even have a job?""";;;;
256;i have never written a negative review before i usually chalk it up to someone having a bad day;;;;
257;i have worked in customer service for 10+ years and i know it is exhausting and bad days happen;;;;
258;but this is a special occasion;;;;
259;i drove 30 minutes to try to find someone who could help me repair a watch band;;;;
260;i was barely greeted upon arrival and right away felt like i was bothering them;;;;
261;"the girl behind the counter obviously just wanted me to leave the blond kid working snapped at me when i asked a question and when i re-asked in order to clarify what he said he snapped again and said ""i already told you?!?""  ""is this even authentic?""  shouting at me over his shoulder as he work on something else";;;;
262;i was shocked and just stood there put my watch away awkwardly and left with no one else saying a word to me;;;;
263;there are a lot of places that fix jewelry in this city and i will be taking my business elsewhere and recommend that people reading this review do the same;;;;
264;some places just do not deserve a loyal customer base;;;;
265;their pettuccine was fresh-made in the morning;;;;
266;it was very delicate and yummy! the owner and staffs are super kind and delightful;;;;
267;we also had veal piccata;;;;
268;it was classic! love this restaurant;;;;
269;if i can give this place no stars i would i only had their hot pot though so im not a good judge for anything besides their shabu;;;;
270;i must say quantity was small price is expensive for the quality and quantity and the taste of the soup base is bland as if they just put hot water in;;;;
271;the sauce selection is limited and not very fresh/clean from my perspective;;;;
272;i love hot pot and i would never go back again because home made hot pot can be much better than this place without even trying;;;;
273;anyways if you have a good appetite for hot pot you can do yourself a favor and skip this place because it can make you miserable!;;;;
274;this review is in regards to our experience watching superbowl 51 february 5 2017 at the westgate in the theater/auditorium;;;;
275;watch the game somewhere else;;;;
276;to those unfamiliar with the big game experience at westgate you typically would get in line to watch the superbowl in the theater portion of the hotel around 8 am on superbowl sunday;;;;
277;this line can get extremely long yet the earlier you get in line your choice of seating significantly improves;;;;
278;after waiting in line for a few hours we were notified the lower portion of the theater was reserved for paid customers who previously purchased wristbands for $100 (including alcohol and hot dogs) and instead we would be seated in the balcony portion of the theater;;;;
279;no problem something different we said;;;;
280;mistake;;;;
281;so at 1;;;;
282;30 pm we were sent upstairs to the balcony to take our seats and prepare to watch the big game at 3;;;;
283;once we take our seats one of us ( we're in a group of 8 ) will hold the seats while the rest of us will go out to the casino floor and gamble or go the the sports book and place a couple last minute bets;;;;
284;please note the patrons that leave the auditorium will receive a hand stamp or wristband to allow reentry to the theater;;;;
285;but instead;;;;
286;we were told by westgate staff that no hand stamps or wristbands would be given and we were on our own if we choose to leave and we would not be allowed back in;;;;
287;wow;;;;
288;that's right after waiting in line all morning if we wanted to go downstairs to play blackjack place a bet at the book or maybe have a bite to eat because no food was made available upstairs we would be out of luck;;;;
289;nice work westgate;;;;
290;so we were seated upstairs;;;;
291;stuck;;;;
292;with no food or soda available for purchase;;;;
293;only beer and water was sold in the balcony food counter;;;;
294;that was at 1;;;;
295;45 p;;;;
296;after vigorously complaining to westgate staff ( to ushers with yellow jackets and security with black jackets ) at 3;;;;
297;04 pm wristbands were given out;;;;
298;at 3;;;;
299;18 hot dogs and soda were made available for sale in the balcony;;;;
300;i believe this was a direct result of all the upset patrons like myself that were seated in the balcony level;;;;
301;in summary for being the biggest sportbook in las vegas this place is dysfunction and fails to satisfy the most basic request to provide food and comfort to betting patrons;;;;
302;a total mess;;;;
303;this place sucks;;;;
304;watch the big game and bet your money some where else;;;;
305;we will;;;;
306;ended up here because raku was closed and it received great ratings on yelp;;;;
307;i'm so glad i came here;;;;
308;one of the better meals i've had;;;;
309;started off with the mushroom dish and the lettuce wrap;;;;
310;both were amazing;;;;
311;the lettuce wrap is like having a flavor party in your mouth;;;;
312;also had the panang duck which was terrific;;;;
313;highly recommend all three dishes;;;;
314;one dish that wasn't so good was the seabass with drunken noodles;;;;
315;overall it was an excellent meal intimate setting and great service;;;;
316;definitely will be back;;;;
317;i tried this place because my girls are away for a month and i really wanted to try to wait until they came back because nobody can hold a candle to them but my toes were desperate;;;;
318;when i went in they were almost twice what i usually pay to begin with;;;;
319;then before starting the pedicure i specifically told them i already had gel polish on my toes;;;;
320;"they didn't tell me right then and there ""that will be an extra $5'";;;;
321;no they waited until it was time to pay and not only charged me for that but they charged me all kinds of extra fees that i didn't even ask for!  i had also informed the girl that my toenail was loose and needed gluing;;;;
322;while i was looking at my phone all of a sudden i felt this sensation and she ripped off my toenail!!!!  without even asking me!!!!!!  so then she had another girl come and put acrylic on there since the nail underneath was only 1/2 grown;;;;
323;again they didn't tell me how much this would be or even ask my permission they just charged me at the end;;;;
324;the added stone 'massage' was barely a massage!  she rubbed the stones up my lower legs a couple times and that was it;;;;
325;it lasted about 30 seconds;;;;
326;and when i asked for a design i'm used to getting a board with a bunch of designs to choose from;;;;
327;she didn't even ask me what i wanted she just painted a few lines on my two toes and then charge me 5 more dollars for that!;;;;
328;ugh i don't care how ugly my toes look next time i will never go anywhere else besides bella nails again they rock!!!!!!!  this place was appalling;;;;
329;i didn't want to make a scene so i just paid the money but i will never go back!!!!!!!;;;;
330;love this place downtown but the scottsdale location has no manners;;;;
331;sat at bar for 10 min while bartender ignored us;;;;
332;no menu no water;;;;
333;we walked out and they could have cared less;;;;
334;best chinese resto;;;;
335;highly recommended;;;;
336;5 stars;;;;
337;let us support this business;;;;
338;best in the west valley;;;;
339;trust me you wont gi wrong coming to this place;;;;
340;came here on a thursday night at 6;;;;
341;30 p;;;;
342;my friends and i had a reservation but it was not needed - the place was almost empty;;;;
343;service;;;;
344;extremely poor;;;;
345;while i enjoyed the company of my friends i would not come back to this restaurant primarily because of the poor service;;;;
346;once we were all seated we were not greeted by anyone for over half an hour and when someone did come by we asked whether we could place our orders to which he said he could not;;;;
347;he's doing something else - so we waited at least another 15 minutes before someone came to finally take our orders;;;;
348;main;;;;
349;caprese salad;;;;
350;the salad was okay - a bit salty for my liking;;;;
351;i personally did not find this dish filling so i ordered the sweet potato fries as well (see below);;;;
352;main;;;;
353;sweet potato fries (this was worth it);;;;
354;these fries were actually very delicious - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside;;;;
355;if you visit this restaurant i would recommend this particular dish especially given the price ($8) and the portion size (it was quite large - almost the size of a large plate);;;;
356;went here last weekend and was pretty disappointed;;;;
357;they did not have one thing that was pictured and recommended on yelp as being good;;;;
358;we started off with the steak grilled skewers which were just ok nothing special;;;;
359;my freind got the lasagna and i got some special chicken dish;;;;
360;they were both pretty bland and lacking that kick;;;;
361;our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes;;;;
362;my freind got the hamburger and i got the shrimp scampi;;;;
363;her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor;;;;
364;my scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked;;;;
365;with such a big name attached to this restaurant and going on such an empty stomach we had such high hopes;;;;
366;the service was great which is why i gave it three stars;;;;
367;this place epitomizes the rumored transformation that is in the process of taking place in pittsburgh;;;;
368;great food drinks and service but the atmosphere is second to none;;;;
369;"definitely a must visit for locals and visitors alike! you will not feel like you're in ""pittsburgh""";;;;
370;dinner was fantastic! service was great we started with the corn soup and the tuna tartare;;;;
371;we shared the filet and scallops;;;;
372;both delicious entrees! we didn't realize the steak came with potatoes and ordered two sides mac and cheese and shishito peppers;;;;
373;i thought the peppers were really hot but i'm a whimp i guess! we will definitely come back;;;;
374;they keep there appointments on time and are pretty efficient;;;;
375;however i am very disappointed in how they think that just because i am a girl that i do not know what is going on with my car's tires;;;;
376;the guy that helped me out told me that my two front tires tread was extremely low and that i would be needing two new tires in a month or two;;;;
377;he told me that he could show me the same tires i have on there now and how much they would be;;;;
378;when the i had taken my car to the other discount tire they told me it that my tread was actually still really good for how many miles i have on my car;;;;
379;when he told me the price of the two tires it was around $280;;;;
380;which i had just bought two new ones a couple months before that and they were the same price;;;;
381;so when i bought the two new tires my tire pressure light came on not that long after that;;;;
382;i honestly feel like the tires were not even new and did not look worth $280;;;;
383;met a friend for dinner there tonight;;;;
384;the server only brought us one menu;;;;
385;after she brought us a couple of cokes she didn't come to our table for 20 mins;;;;
386;after trying to get her attention a few times when she walked by we decided to just order off the bartender;;;;
387;we received the starters and the mains at the same time;;;;
388;the wings brisket and mac and cheese were alright at best;;;;
389;at this point we hadn't seen the server since she brought the food so we had to go to the bar for more napkins and refills on the cokes;;;;
390;the most we actually saw our server was when she hovered over us as we put the tip into the handheld credit card terminal;;;;
391;food was somewhere between okay and decent;;;;
392;service was somewhere between piss poor and terrible;;;;
393;another solid bbq place in calgary;;;;
394;this is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious;;;;
395;i actually noticed this place because i wandered by when i was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey/bbq smell if you're on the block;;;;
396;however it looks kind of like a hole in the wall;;;;
397;the entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years and that's ok because it just adds character;;;;
398;the entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends;;;;
399;ok onto the food;;;;
400;i have been here a couple of times now so i think i can comment on the menu pretty well;;;;
401;my friends and i have ordered the brisket the catfish the veggie burger the mac n cheese the cesar salad the chili and the garlic fries;;;;
402;if i had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries this would be a 5-star review hands down;;;;
403;i mean seriously vampires beware but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty;;;;
404;the portion sizes are huge so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time i've gone i have loved the food so much that i ate the entire meal;;;;
405;i bet at this point in time you are wondering why i am only giving this place 4 stars then? well not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries;;;;
406;the bourbon apples are fairly tasteless the chili is ok (the meat was very tough) and the service is also just ok;;;;
407;however the catfish is delightful the mac and cheese is also delicious and the brisket is quality;;;;
408;the specialty cocktails are also pretty good and the beer prices are pretty decent;;;;
409;this is a great place to go for a long lunch after dinner drink or even a weekend brunch;;;;
410;there are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and i believe even a few gluten-free options as well;;;;
411;it's a fairly good place to go with a large group just make sure to call ahead;;;;
412;all in all like i said earlier a great place for good times and smokey flavor;;;;
413;one day after i satisfy my frozen yogurt craving at kiwispoon;;;;
414;i get invited out to eat frozen yogurt at piccadilly;;;;
415;a rare opportunity to truly compare the two yogurt places;;;;
416;here i tried three flavors - chocolate pumpkin and caramel sea salt;;;;
417;added toppings of brownie bits chocolate caramel turtles and mochi;;;;
418;overall i liked the yogurt better at kiwispoon;;;;
419;the frozen yogurt seems less rich in piccadilly's and the flavors are not as strong;;;;
420;the price per ounce is also marginally higher at piccadilly's;;;;
421;there are definitely pluses to piccadilly's yogurt though;;;;
422;i liked the toppings better - i thought the mochi tasted better the brownie pieces were bigger and the chocolate caramel turtles went great on ice cream;;;;
423;the chocolate caramel turtles should be a standard topping for both frozen yogurt and ice cream places;;;;
424;"also with the huge map of cleveland heights behind the cash register this feels more like an authentic ""neighborhood"" froyo joint";;;;
425;i called the number provided and same day they showed up to my residence for an inspection;;;;
426;was able to advise me of multiple broken and loose tiles on my roof and came out just a few days later and completed the repairs;;;;
427;quoted me a good price for the repairs as well;;;;
428;no complaints!;;;;
429;party of 3 ordered the fish tacos pork belly banh mi corn beef hash benedict and bam ham;;;;
430;everything was delicious esp the pork belly banh mi;;;;
431;it's tender and juicy and the baguette was nicely toasted;;;;
432;love the crispy fish taco too;;;;
433;their compliment chips and salsa were fresh and super good and crispy;;;;
434;service was excellent;;;;
435;our waitress did a great job checking up on us and serving us;;;;
436;i really want other food options too but i'm too full;;;;
437;next time i visit i will definitely come back;;;;
438;we had dinner at the bellagio buffet last night;;;;
439;the service was ok;;;;
440;our server was great but kind of forgot about us towards the end of our visit;;;;
441;the food was cold;;;;
442;the only good thing there was the crab legs because they're suppose to be cold and the tacos because it was freshly made;;;;
443;the food was under a single lamp that didn't heat the food at all;;;;
444;we let the server know that the food was cold and he told the manager that was in charge;;;;
445;all she did was come over to ask what the problem was and said she was going to talk to the chief;;;;
446;have no idea what actually happened though because we didn't see her after that;;;;
447;half the buffet was closed as well so there wasn't that many options;;;;
448;i must say i rather go to the rio buffet;;;;
449;for a high end casino this was a horrible experience;;;;
450;i really enjoyed my visit here;;;;
451;everything was visually appealing to me;;;;
452;ambiance was great;;;;
453;food tasted amazing;;;;
454;service was;;;;
455;no complaints at all;;;;
456;flat out fantastic!  have been here twice and the croissants are the bomb;;;;
457;can't wait until i can try other items;;;;
458;the new breakfast spot in ahwahtukee;;;;
459;the service is great as well;;;;
460;family run business;;;;
461;come and support them;;;;
462;very nice eating environment and the food are quite nice;;;;
463;very native japanese style;;;;
464;notes;;;;
465;1 visit breakfast/lunch;;;;
466;overall;;;;
467;excellent high-end buffet but the dessert section needs a little work;;;;
468;highlights;;;;
469;- dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had;;;;
470;#NAME?;;;;
471;#NAME?;;;;
472;#NAME?;;;;
473;i got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm;;;;
474;crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good;;;;
475;i mean i was stuffed beyond belief but i couldn't stop eating it!;;;;
476;#NAME?;;;;
477;it's the only breakfast food really worth it;;;;
478;avoid;;;;
479;#NAME?;;;;
480;(which i hate) so disappointed;;;;
481;#NAME?;;;;
482;so gross;;;;
483;i am years out from surgery with sacs and i wish i could turn back time;;;;
484;he promises great things them butchers your body;;;;
485;i should have left my body alone;;;;
486;it was not bad;;;;
487;i was out to perfect it;;;;
488;we often talk about how he ruined a good body;;;;
489;i will never forget his dirty nasty slippers coming into the operating room;;;;
490;i should have run from the room then;;;;
491;such a unique place & a great find;;;;
492;our waitress was funny knowledgable and did a fantastic job;;;;
493;the food was amazing;;;;
494;we will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to other couples!;;;;
495;best wonton soup ever!!! delicious food and great service;;;;
496;we had chicken satay roti c;;;;
497;wonton soup and one of the fried noodle and shrimp dishes;;;;
498;definitely will be back!;;;;
499;i've never experienced discrimination as i did last night at this place;;;;
500;i was with 2 other females;;;;
501;we had on dresses and heels;;;;
502;the place was very diverse as far as how everyone was dressed;;;;
503;dresses heels jeans flip flops shorts etc;;;;
504;immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside;;;;
505;we thought nothing of it;;;;
506;assumed they were all on lists;;;;
507;then it just got weird;;;;
508;we noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside;;;;
509;every time it just happened to be groups with caucasian people;;;;
510;4 caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males;;;;
511;the girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside no talk of any lists;;;;
512;the guys were told they must be on a list or leave;;;;
513;the guys left;;;;
514;we watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line;;;;
515;we were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door;;;;
516;funny thing is he didn't make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside;;;;
517;he was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave;;;;
518;i know it wasn't because of how we were dressed or looked;;;;
519;they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops;;;;
520;ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door;;;;
521;"there was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be ""picky"" about who they let inside";;;;
522;it was like a night at suite;;;;
523;safe to say i will never step foot in this place again;;;;
524;we had dinner here and the food was excellent and the service couldn't have been better!;;;;
525;thanks jose!;;;;
526;we will be back for sure;;;;
527;absolutely love this place! i've been here many times and it never fails to impress me  the bff burger is unreal and the tsoynamis and cupcakes are amazing!! everything is pretty much the best;;;;
528;here's why i don't write reviews for chinese restaurants;;;;
529;i have to look up their english names;;;;
530;it's so popular that i didn't try it until recently;;;;
531;the bubble tea here is really good;;;;
532;it's pricier than the one in rose tea but you also get more;;;;
533;i like that noodles with pork sauce;;;;
534;i've tried both the thin and wide/thick noodles;;;;
535;the wide one is less chewy and are kind of sticky;;;;
536;i prefer the thin one for this dish;;;;
537;dan dan noodles are different from what i was expecting;;;;
538;my friend liked it but it's just okay for me;;;;
539;the noodle with wonton is flavorless to me;;;;
540;the soup dumplings are good but not amazing;;;;
541;if you've never had it before give it a try and you probably will like it;;;;
542;i'd like to try noodles with beef soup next time;;;;
543;the appetizers are too pricy in my opinion;;;;
544;i won't pay $6 for a small plate of vegetables again;;;;
545;the owner is a nice guy and i enjoyed chatting with him a little bit during dinners;;;;
546;we went here saturday for dinner;;;;
547;we had a 2-1 coupon;;;;
548;price was $37 for two people so a good deal;;;;
549;very large space open layout;;;;
550;been here a few times years ago;;;;
551;i ate mostly the crab legs;;;;
552;prime rib;;;;
553;they provide a self serve drink area which i think is good;;;;
554;you don't have to flag down a staff to get a drink when you want one;;;;
555;we've all been in that situation;;;;
556;unlimited alcohol wines and beer;;;;
557;they have a bar area with one bartender working and a bunch of tv's to watch or get updates on games;;;;
558;i wouldn't go out of my way but if i was in mirage and hungry i'd eat there if we had another 2-1 coupon;;;;
559;i wouldn't spend full retail price eating there;;;;
560;other buffets on the strip are better for same price points;;;;
561;took my kids here to hang out on one fine 72 degree sunny saturday in february;;;;
562;going over the bridge coming from aliante casino you cant miss the nice view of the waterfall that is at the forefront of the park;;;;
563;too bad this and the playground were the only nice things i can vouch for;;;;
564;the playground is a nice fenced in little area that has a decent amount of playground equipment swings slides tables and benches;;;;
565;i like the soft material they use that the playground equipment is built on;;;;
566;there is also a sand lot area that has dinosaur bones as props;;;;
567;the day we went the playground was packed;;;;
568;kids were running into each other as they went down the slides;;;;
569;there were kids actually waiting to get on the swings!;;;;
570;after a while we decided to walk around to check out the rest of the park;;;;
571;we see ducks everywhere especially in the pond that has the nice waterfall going into it;;;;
572;"unfortunately this is where the ""nice stuff"" ends";;;;
573;everywhere on the paths we were walking on were green duck crap;;;;
574;"which brings the question ""is there some kind of spray or force field they have on the playground?"" because there were no ducks or green duck crap anywhere in the playground";;;;
575;im also curious as to how many people would actually spread out a blanket and have a picnic on the grass for the crap was all over that as well;;;;
576;just doing this review im starting to get grossed out thinking about that day;;;;
577;after carefully trying not to step on any crap going to the car i made a mental note to make sure to mention all the green crap i saw in this review and to not hesitate in mentioning it to everybody i know that is either making plans on coming here or are just thinking about it;;;;
578;the only thing positive i can think of about that is to come here if you are on a diet;;;;
579;after seeing all the green crap you probably wont be having much of an appetite and you definitely will get some exercise trying to avoid stepping on the stuff;;;;
580;so yeah im not worried about coming back to this place any time soon in this lifetime;;;;
581;(you think?);;;;
582;lol;;;;
583;maybe as a duck;;;;
584;there is a reason i frequent paul's ace over the big names such as home depot or lowes;;;;
585;the personalized assistance;;;;
586;do the big name brands provide this? yes bit not at the same level paul's ace hardware does in tempe;;;;
587;if i need help they are ready and willing to help me in every aspect of my project;;;;
588;the store manager bras personally went out if his way to assist me in gathering all the materials i needed for my current project;;;;
589;he knows his store bounced around to show me all options and seemed to have recommendations on each project;;;;
590;this guy must love what he does because he knows everything in the store (or he is a constant do-it-yourselfer);;;;
591;i am always pleased with the help i receive and am thankful this place is in my neighborhood;;;;
592;in need of a burger this was the closest location from work that wasn't your typical fast food joint;;;;
593;i always like to chose a signature burger so i opted for the spicy cajun burger and combo'd it up with there beer battered rings and a jones strawberry-lime  soda;;;;
594;its a small location with an even smaller patio ( maybe 8 bar stools on a cramped balcony) that looks onto charles street;;;;
595;but definitely sit outside if you can grab a seat;;;;
596;luckily the patio was vacant that late afternoon;;;;
597;toppings - they spicy cajun burger - avocado jalapeã±os lettuce,;;;;
598;jalapeã±o havarti tomatoes cajun spice & smokey chipotle & honey mayo;;;;
599;there was ample toppings on the burger i enjoyed the avocado on my burger overall not too spicy but good kick from the sliced jalapeã±os;;;;
600;meat - grilled perfectly tasted average but i found it too small compared to the bun;;;;
601;bun - very soft tasted good but didn't hold up against the burger and all the toppings and at the end i was left with lots of bun and no more burger;;;;
602;beer battered onion rings - very thick batter on these rings golden brown crunchy very filling;;;;
603;drink -jones strawberry-lime soda - yummy not sour but good balance,;;;;
604;overall prompt friendly service quaint little patio average burger but good for a quick fix in satisfying the burger craving;;;;
605;sadly this place has been sold;;;;
606;the gas prices have sky rocketed some of the long term staff is gone lottery is gone they have run out of popular cigarettes i tried to get gas a few days ago and the vendors / delivery trucks that used to park on the side street or off to the side were parked at the pumps;;;;
607;i am going to give it a little time and see if it gets better;;;;
608;i have been going to this store for 15+ years but if it doesn't shape up i will find another;;;;
609;easily entering my top 3 restaurants in charlotte after just one visit!;;;;
610;pork belly unreal! had an amazing prime ny strip with bourbon butter jam phenomenal!;;;;
611;so good! they didn't make it to 5 stars due to the prices are a bit high for the amount of food and the location is a bit unsavory;;;;
612;the decor and atmosphere was surprisingly nice from the outside i expected to be more run down inside;;;;
613;the staff was very nice;;;;
614;we were surprised how empty the dining room was for a friday evening;;;;
615;we got vegetable samosas to start then ordered chicken tikka masala lamb rogan josh rice and plain naan;;;;
616;our only complaint was the lamb could've been more tender but everything was flavorful and delicious;;;;
617;i would definitely go again if given the chance;;;;
618;employees were to busy chatting with each other;;;;
619;one employee had his head out the  drive thru window talking to people the entire time i was there;;;;
620;the cook come from outside and made my food;;;;
621;did he was hands before making my food???;;;;
622;this random hole in the wall is located in the park rd;;;;
623;shopping center;;;;
624;i had never heard of it until that fateful st;;;;
625;patricks day when another beer was in order;;;;
626;after making my way there and enjoying the patio i decided the food was my next venture;;;;
627;after my second alcohol only visit i was excited to taste what vegetarian options they had;;;;
628;i had the grilled cheese with spicy asparagus and portobello;;;;
629;let me tell you;;;;
630;grilled cheese is amazing add a few interesting touches it becomes addicting;;;;
631;i was very happy with my sandwich;;;;
632;also they have a very tasty appetizer of goat cheese fritters with a red wine sauce;;;;
633;goat cheese is one of my favorites and frying anything makes it better;;;;
634;i was in love;;;;
635;ther service is great and they can accomadate large groups the few times i've been has been with 7-20 people;;;;
636;great staff awesome menu choices i'll be going back;;;;
637;((( ladies beware))) don't ever take your machine to 35th ave;;;;
638;sew and vac on northern they broke my elna machine while it was being repaired;;;;
639;i've spent over $10;;;;
640;000 at their store over the years and have been a long time customer;;;;
641;bill the owners son was so rude to me and did nothing to resolve my broken machine;;;;
642;i was disgusted when bill the owners daughter wouldn't do any thing to help me when the repair man broke my machine;;;;
643;it's terrible to bring a nice sewing machine in to be repaired and these people broke it while in their possession and they don't want to do a damm thing about it;;;;
644;it was like a big (screw you) to me;;;;
645;i won't buy another thing from these people for the way i was treated;;;;
646;even the material is too over priced;;;;
647;i'm in the market for another machine but i won't go there ever again;;;;
648;my machine still needs to be taken care of and they still have not resolved this issue;;;;
649;its still broken and it happened while repairman was servicing my machine;;;;
650;i wish i had never taken my machine to 35th ave sew and vac shop;;;;
651;why cant people own up to take ownership to their responsibility for their own mistakes!!!! go to kings sewing machines much better service and they dont break your machine!!!!!;;;;
652;great tanning salon near me and clean equipped with the latest tech and easy checkin and out spot for a short yet amazing relaxation and sunbathing time in chilli cleveland;;;;
653;i am going to be obsessed with this place in winters and will recharge myself with vitamin d!;;;;
654;th service here is very hit or miss;;;;
655;sometimes the staff is personable and attentive;;;;
656;"other times i ask myself ""why do i come here???"" the staff often has the  ""gtfoh"" stamp placed permanently across their foreheads and we as patrons just have to go with it otherwise we are deemed ""that guy";;;;
657;"""  i would say that my continuos visits were for the great hh but there are several other options close to home with the same food and drink options for me to choose from";;;;
658;i think today may be last visit;;;;
659;great cocktails and very good food;;;;
660;overall first class restaurant;;;;
661;i took my wife out for a birthday dinner with my daughter on 12-16-14  at alfonsos;;;;
662;i heard the food was good and it was and my waitress ( dawn ) was also good ( even with it being very busy );;;;
663;the problem i have is some of the waitress staff are rude;;;;
664;i had a gift card/ certificate to pay for dinner;;;;
665;after a few minutes a big blond waitress came over and said  ( in a loud and rude tone ) i couldn't use it cause i needed to spend $100;;;;
666;00 in order to get $50;;;;
667;00 off;;;;
668;she then insulted me by saying (so the tables around me could hear ) couldn't i read the fine print telling me of requirements to use gift card;;;;
669;i showed her the certificate and the fine print was not legible she told me sorry that's not our fault it's yours and she walked away;;;;
670;i am having second thoughts about going back to use gift card;;;;
671;i may give it away or toss it out;;;;
672;this company tried deliver flowers to our home- my son was home by himself and called me;;;;
673;i had him keep me on the phone while he opened the front door (our security screen door was  locked though);;;;
674;he told the gal that he was not going to open the door that his mom (me) was on the phone and he asked the driver to call me his mom;;;;
675;the driver was very insistent about getting a signature and became argumentative;;;;
676;my son kept saying call my mom she's on the phone now;;;;
677;and she kept interrupting and insistent on a signature;;;;
678;i told my son to close the door;;;;
679;i then called the company and spoke with a manager sara;;;;
680;she understood my concern and said she would make sure the driver was trained on these situations;;;;
681;three days pass and i still don't have my flowers or a phone call;;;;
682;i called and spoke with sara and she had a completely different tone with me than previously;;;;
683;she was very curt and tried to give me lots of excuses;;;;
684;i asked that the owners call me;;;;
685;five days later i've never received a call back from the owner or my flowers;;;;
686;i called to find out when one of the owners would call back and linda told me it would be by friday which meant six days later than my initial request;;;;
687;i told linda that was pretty unreasonable and she told me that the owners are busy and have several other businesses;;;;
688;in my opinion that's completely unacceptable- do yourself a favor and do not order from this company;;;;
689;they are very unprofessional and not very concerned about customer service;;;;
690;heard about this place and was dying to check it put-and i'm very glad i did! decent beer selection and kind of a hipster vibe but $8 for a loaded hot dog and tater tots has got to be one of the best deals in town;;;;
691;tons of unique toppings to pick from and delicious dipping sauces for tots (secret fry sauce was my fav);;;;
692;we were there early and had no problem getting a seat at the bar but i can see how during prime time or when live music is on how it could be kind of tight;;;;
693;if you're going for the food is get there earlyu because that loaded dog would have been super hard to eat while standing;;;;
694;received a  mailer and thought okay let's go;;;;
695;walked in on a monday afternoon greeted by a bartender wearing a cute  t shirt that said the bar and below that the baby;;;;
696;how cute however never got her name;;;;
697;looked over menu asked what was good she said the club;;;;
698;so ordered it and  yes it is good;;;;
699;had a beer a club on white toast served with fries and watched sport center;;;;
700;really felt at ease there and good music playing;;;;
701;will go back again;;;;
702;met an old close friend for dinner at portofino;;;;
703;great intimate dinning with class;;;;
704;excellent pasta and meat dishes;;;;
705;delightful service and great drinks;;;;
706;will come back!;;;;
707;my company hosted a dinner and awards night at the hotel last night and the experience was the best we could have imagined! working with kristine cole was fantastic and the communication was always on point;;;;
708;i walked in to be blown away by the set up and i had compliments on the food all night;;;;
709;i came into work today to be flooded with emails on how impressed everyone was with the presentation;;;;
710;the staff that was there to help us was great! i believe tim was in charge and he had anna and one other gentleman with him and they made us laugh and gave us the privacy we needed;;;;
711;we will be back and i will be recommending them to everyone!;;;;
712;yes;;;;
713;the boba tea explosion is in full force;;;;
714;i have been to lee lee international supermarket in chandler many times but i never noticed this little gem next to it until a couple years ago;;;;
715;boba tea house has serving up some of the best boba tea in the valley long before it became a big thing;;;;
716;they have a fantastic array of flavors and drink choices to choose like fruit slushes snow milk tea pudding mango jelly coffee jelly etc;;;;
717;they even have snacks like popcorn chicken fried tofu and fries;;;;
718;the staff is super friendly and the prices are reasonable;;;;
719;i still laugh at my friends who have no idea what boba tea is or are too afraid to suck up one of those chewy ball things;;;;
720;lol;;;;
721;in case you didn't know boba tea is a flavored tea (usually with milk) to which chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies are added;;;;
722;i think they are super delicious;;;;
723;today i got the blueberry milk boba tea and it made for the perfect snack in the middle of my day;;;;
724;another favorite of my mine is the honeydew milk tea;;;;
725;yum!! had the kale grits and would definitely have those again! menu choices are unique farm fresh and delicious!;;;;
726;i stumbled upon this ice cream store and seeing the high reviews on yelp went in with high expectations;;;;
727;first off the prices are fairly high considering the size of the cones and cups they use;;;;
728;it's almost $4 for a small scoop which is pretty overpriced in my opinion;;;;
729;their flavours are a little more creative than most traditional ice cream stores and it is marginally creamier;;;;
730;the noah i had was pretty neat with some different ingredients mixed into it as well;;;;
731;but not worth that price and on some hot summer days that lineup;;;;
732;also note that it is a tiny store that fits no more than a dozen people so don't expect to sit inside enjoying your ice cream there;;;;
733;ooooooh yummy;;;;
734;i'm a red meat eating midwestern girl and 9 had the best steak i can remember having in;;;;
735;who knows how long it was damn good;;;;
736;the mac and cheese is a tasty tasty side;;;;
737;try the snicker dessert;;;;
738;it's basically two cookie/ice cream sanwiches with bits of snickers;;;;
739;the s'mores my sister got were super fun too;;;;
740;only complaint is that it was really loud and waaaaaaay too many annoying veil-toting bachelorette parties for my taste;;;;
741;but hey it is the palms;;;;
742;dreadful service;;;;
743;i've had jimmy john's before several years ago in minneapolis;;;;
744;but apparently here in phoenix the store personnel must be trained differently;;;;
745;i had to take my sandwich back up to the counter twice to get the thick headed folks working at the one on camelback at about 16th to get my sandwich the way i wanted it;;;;
746;i asked for a #10 hunter's club with all the veggies;;;;
747;what i got was the standard #10 hunters club with lettuce and tomatoes;;;;
748;after seeing that i took it back up to the counter and explained that i wanted all the veggies;;;;
749;they explained to me that those were all the veggies the sandwich came with;;;;
750;i carefully explained that i wanted all of the veggies that they have;;;;
751;the guy said oh you want the freebies;;;;
752;i would have thought he would have clarified when i ordered whether i just wanted everything that came on the sandwich or the freebies as well;;;;
753;i said yes i wanted all of the freebie veggies;;;;
754;i took my revised sandwich and sat down to eat it only to find that along with the veggies i had requested they had piled on italian vinaigrette and dijon mustard which i did not want;;;;
755;these burgers are phenomenal! the galley boy just melts in your mouth and paired with the potato teasers and a milkshake it is like heaven on earth;;;;
756;i got stuck in myrtle beach last week and stayed here waiting for another flight;;;;
757;very clean comfortable and right near the airport;;;;
758;i would definitely stay again;;;;
759;#1 it should be advertised as a vegetarian dinner;;;;
760;for the price we paid i really would have liked a nice cut of meat;;;;
761;way over priced;;;;
762;dinner for 2 with (2) blue moon beers and (1) $10 glass of wine;;;;
763;$165+tip;;;;
764;we tipped over 25% because our server was great and the experience of eating in the dark was a pretty interesting experience;;;;
765;the food was meh;;;;
766;i would have been okay with everything else if the food was outstanding;;;;
767;it really wasn't;;;;
768;i probably ate 3 bites of my dinner entree just to taste what the different ingredients were;;;;
769;it was far from savory and could have used even a pasta or something;;;;
770;a couple of dry (what tasted like hush puppies)?? i would have been impressed a little if when i told the server that i didn't enjoy it if he would have offered to try one of the others but i didn't make a big deal because like i said before he was really nice;;;;
771;the dessert was literally the only saving grace;;;;
772;all in all i gave a 2 star;;;;
773;(server and experience in the dark);;;;
774;i just have to be honest incase others go in expecting a non-vegetarian meal;;;;
775;be ready for a $200 vegetarian dinner!!!!;;;;
776;*** also if they don't like your review on their facebook page they will block you from commenting on other people talking crap about you they can not handle the truth and allow others to put you down ***;;;;
777;first off food is delicious! by far my favorite restaurant in downtown phoenix;;;;
778;i have tried so many different things from the menu and it never disappoints but the saturday night special prime rib and horseradish dauphinoise potato is my favorite;;;;
779;second the service is amazing;;;;
780;ian is my favorite waiter will request him every time! he is so personable with a good sense of humor! he constantly is checking up to make sure everything is good (but not too much);;;;
781;he made the experience at the arrogant butcher memorable!;;;;
782;at least the pinks concession stand by section 3;;;;
783;unqualified servers who don't tell you that they won't take cash - and they seriously won't take cash;;;;
784;then the manager wouldn't even take the cash to another register;;;;
785;the lines are stupid;;;;
786;long and the workers incapable of handling the slightest issue;;;;
787;i m sitting upstairs if there is a next time i come to a knights game;;;;
788;wonderful experience;;;;
789;we sat outside on the patio and watched the food channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests;;;;
790;the patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child;;;;
791;if you have a need for food with a great bite to it this is the spot;;;;
792;we only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8;;;;
793;our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table;;;;
794;we ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni;;;;
795;tuna was fresh;;;;
796;wontons not greasy;;;;
797;wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna;;;;
798;pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot;;;;
799;pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp;;;;
800;entree's were big enough to serve two people! beef brisket beef short ribs pork ribs caesar salad bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor;;;;
801;caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! caesar dressing was fresh;;;;
802;corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty;;;;
803;ordered the cheesecake for dessert;;;;
804;it was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there;;;;
805;asked our server to put the pretzels fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top which they did;;;;
806;if your stomach is sensitive you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss;;;;
807;it's not that the food is spicy it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy;;;;
808;for some people it may be too much but for me this is a good thing!;;;;
809;i was told so many great things about this place but my entire experience was awful;;;;
810;the food wasn't very good way too greasy;;;;
811;my fries were luke warm and my tray was literally covered in grease;;;;
812;i needed about 50 napkins and a shower after that;;;;
813;the service was pretty awful too;;;;
814;i can't believe i paid $14 for a small meal with no extra fixings;;;;
815;on national cheeseburger day of all days too;;;;
816;such a disappointment and i've never gone back since;;;;
817;best thing about it was the soda but that's pretty difficult to mess up;;;;
818;"came here for the ""midnight"" launch of the psvr";;;;
819;after previously being told by another employee a week prior to get there at 6;;;;
820;01pm to get one of the six extra systems that weren't pre-ordered and that it was first come first serve i ended up not able to get a system;;;;
821;when i came in yesterday the woman behind the counter told me they had written down names and numbers of people who wanted one a few days prior and that they all were accounted for;;;;
822;the previous employee even told me i was the first person to have asked about it;;;;
823;if they were organized and told all their employees customers could put their names down on a psvr i could have gotten a system last night;;;;
824;not only did this illiminate my chances of getting a system at gamestop but made it too late for me to go to other department stores who had stock (as they were too far away and lines were already forming at each location);;;;
825;not happy;;;;
826;this place is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in phoenix;;;;
827;my favorites are the chicken scarpariello the pizza and the sangria;;;;
828;my wife can't decide between four dishes;;;;
829;our daughter loves the penne ala vodka lasagna or ravioli;;;;
830;mario and his sons work hard to please and we've never had a bad meal here;;;;
831;i've seen them bend over backwards to try and take care of obvious jerks;;;;
832;plus to top it off when local school invited local pizza places to present to a class on making pizza and recycling issues mario came and talked to the kids as if they were adults;;;;
833;all the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons;;;;
834;get the idea? it's all good at this neighborhood gem!;;;;
835;& dr;;;;
836;together with their agape team are caring professional thorough and knowledgeable;;;;
837;& dr;;;;
838;will holistically bring your health & well being back into balance not just treat individual injuries;;;;
839;each visit is carefully tailored to your current state of being and needs;;;;
840;man i love toronto! hiding in a strip mall on overlea find a dingy looking restaurant that serves up fantastic cheap kabob;;;;
841;be warned regardless of when you come here you'll likely be waiting for a table as this place is always overrun with people;;;;
842;if you're a fan of perfectly grilled spicy meat you must try this place out;;;;
843;now that i've been here i need to limit how many times i go here per month;;;;
844;take the drive out and have some kabob;;;;
845;if you don't own a car borrow one or get a zipcar membership;;;;
846;totally worth it!;;;;
847;today was my first time seeing the staff at bella smile and it was a great experience;;;;
848;although i'm not currently living in las vegas i plan on coming back for checkups and any other problems that may arise;;;;
849;there was no wait time whatsoever and i was out of there without a drop of pain or discomfort;;;;
850;the manager severn was very accommodating and will be getting business from my family and friends in town;;;;
851;i've taken my kids here several times and we've never had to wait more then 5 minutes;;;;
852;we go right up sign in and they usually call us back right as i'm done signing their paperwork;;;;
853;the doctors have always been super nice;;;;
854;my daughter had stitches done and she was a nervous wreck;;;;
855;the staff tried so hard to make her comfortable and gave her a stuffed toy when she was done;;;;
856;it was very nice;;;;
857;i wish they would open a bit earlier in the day;;;;
858;otherwise they're great;;;;
859;one of the crappier marriotts i've ever stayed at;;;;
860;the staff is nice and professional enough;;;;
861;but the fact that it's right by the frontage road along i-17 you tend to attract a seedier crowd;;;;
862;also with three floors worth of rooms here guess how many washer/dryer they have for everyone? one crappy washer and one crappy dryer! don't even think about washing your clothes on a friday night;;;;
863;for a two hour period i went to see if the washer was finally available each time i was met with yet another load of dirty clothes inside;;;;
864;if they can't afford to get more machines consider installing one of those number ticket dispensers! just a thought;;;;
865;maybe i would have a better shot of washing my clothes;;;;
866;i also considered sitting on top of the washer until the load was done but that would be kind of creepy on my part;;;;
867;i will be packing all my dirty clothes with me and never come back here again;;;;
868;beer beer and more beer;;;;
869;it's definitely a low-key nieghborhood bar;;;;
870;as an out of towner i enjoyed it;;;;
871;it felt like pittsburgh's version of cheers except grimier;;;;
872;unfortunately the kitchen closes fairly early on weekdays otherwise this place may have received another star;;;;
873;love the crust on this pizza;;;;
874;the sauce is decent cheese is okay the pepperoni was not the best quality;;;;
875;my friend ordered an everything slice said it was good just wished so cheese was on the toppings to hold it together;;;;
876;normally i give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food;;;;
877;however our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant;;;;
878;granted we were expecting a lot from an italian restaurant in the venetian but i also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices;;;;
879;first we changed our reservation and they said they could accommodate the time;;;;
880;clearly they shouldn't have;;;;
881;we were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists;;;;
882;whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me;;;;
883;they shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault wouldn't blame them);;;;
884;i know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up;;;;
885;a few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was;;;;
886;i expected to pay a lot in the venetian but i expected to be blown away;;;;
887;i would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one;;;;
888;i paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara;;;;
889;it was very tasty a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta;;;;
890;however i finished the whole thing;;;;
891;i can't finish an entree at olive garden for the same price;;;;
892;i also ate a few pieces of bread;;;;
893;one of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an italian restaurant);;;;
894;it was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! absolutely outrageous;;;;
895;to top it off we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday;;;;
896;he said ok so i expected we would receive a dessert as is customary;;;;
897;we received nothing;;;;
898;of course our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so i don't know why i expected him to remember a birthday;;;;
899;i'm not that familiar with scottsdale so i'm just guessing that this restaurant is fairly new;;;;
900;the atmosphere is great and lively but s but loud;;;;
901;they have a huge wine and drink list;;;;
902;the food was really good i highly recommend the ahi tuna appetizer ravioli and the skirt steak!;;;;
903;"""good morning cocktails for you?""";;;;
904;wait;;;;
905;what? oh;;;;
906;it's vegas!;;;;
907;dining here you best not be dieting because this place is literally the definition of excess but in a good way;;;;
908;i'm a sucker for benedicts so that was awesome;;;;
909;service was really great too and the staff was so welcoming;;;;
910;it was our first stop just after landing so really appreciate the service;;;;
911;back in hawaii this reminds me of zippys or anna millers - that home feeling;;;;
912;prices are a bit high but for what you get it's totally worth it;;;;
913;will remember this place if i ever return to vegas in the future;;;;
914;hands down best bloody mary ever;;;;
915;so many things in my bm veggies  mmm bacon;;;;
916;"""nailed it"" it's an appetizer";;;;
917;i also had the burger with fries;;;;
918;who knew fries could be so good;;;;
919;the presentation doesn't disappoint ether;;;;
920;very nice;;;;
921;great seating outside although we sat inside;;;;
922;would love to see this restaurant near my hometown;;;;
923;seriously;;;;
924;get the bm;;;;
925;you rock guy!;;;;
926;they charged me twice what i expected to pay;;;;
927;"the guy at the counter small-talked me asked me if i wanted ""any additional insurance"" - i said no - and just initialed where he told me to not noticing that one thing i initialed was collision waiver insurance which i did not need and ended up doubling the original cost";;;;
928;he did not walk me through the additional cost and may even have been purposely misleading by distracting me with small talk;;;;
929;i am an experienced traveler and nothing like this has happened to me before;;;;
930;"when i returned the car and expressed my surprise at the doubled cost they essentially said ""well you signed it"" and ""it's worth it anyway";;;;
931;""" i will never rent from this payless again";;;;
932;quiet bar and grill great waitress and the margarita pizza was very good;;;;
933;small sign out front and almost missed the place;;;;
934;they came out when they said they would did the job in the amount of time they said it would take for the amount they said it would cost;;;;
935;they sold me exactly what i needed to hopefully keep my basement from flooding and didn't try to sell me a bunch of things i didn't need subsequently their quote was 1/3 of those other waterproofing guys and i'm willing to bet my basement will stay dry just as long! thanks to nick's crew!;;;;
936;the o'donnells;;;;
937;this is my first yelp;;;;
938;this restaurant was soo good i felt compelled to yelp about it;;;;
939;went for dinner with a friend of mine really nice space;;;;
940;all the staff were amazing!!  the chef even came out to our table which was cool;;;;
941;and the food well i think even the most discerning top chef judges would be impressed;;;;
942;a++ across the board;;;;
943;we had the tenderloin and mac and cheese;;;;
944;as well as the tomatoes two ways both are excellent choices;;;;
945;i can't wait to go back;;;;
946;cielo kudos;;;;
947;overall the food is really good;;;;
948;we had bruschetta and it seemed to have just a tad bit too much olive oil on it;;;;
949;had it had anymore on it we would not have eaten it;;;;
950;my husband had chicken parmesan and i ordered a salad with grilled salmon;;;;
951;he said his tasted good and my salon was cooked perfect;;;;
952;i also enjoyed whatever the dressing was i just wish it would have been on the side;;;;
953;for whatever reason it was poured on and also came with a cup of it on the side;;;;
954;we agreed that the prices seemed a bit high for the experience;;;;
955;it has a similar feel to bravo but service just isn't at that level yet (from our experience);;;;
956;our sever did not know anything about the menu or what is fried in their fryers which should be expected at $18+ a plate;;;;
957;(we asked because of food allergies) she did however make sure to note allergies on our order which we appreciated! the music also did not match the setting;;;;
958;i really wanted to relax but the music was super up beat and almost had me rushing to leave;;;;
959;we will try again in a few months and i'll update my review then;;;;
960;prc consulted on 2 tile roof replacements at apartment communities we manage in the greater phoenix area;;;;
961;prc was thorough and caught a number of items the roofer needed to correct on both jobs;;;;
962;their communication was great;;;;
963;a roof is a major investment and having a professional help manage installation is money well spent;;;;
964;the specific services provided were initial condition and spec reports and roughly 5 job inspections per property;;;;
965;awful place;;;;
966;staff is not nice very rude;;;;
967;they never seem to want to help at all;;;;
968;their service is not up to par & always out of bagels;;;;
969;so many great this about yoga factory! excellent teachers very friendly and professional;;;;
970;they have been very patient with my practice but know how to push me to meet my goals;;;;
971;amazing location very easily accessible very easy city parking! nice large space in the hot room never did i feel like my elbow room was compromised and the room can get packed! the facility is clean neat and i love the choice of decor;;;;
972;highly recommended for a first-timer or for someone who has a frequent practice very friendly and welcoming place;;;;
973;i have no idea what the owner's problem is but he's incredibly rude;;;;
974;his wife on the other hand is super nice (an odd mix);;;;
975;great space rude owner and the coffee is average;;;;
976;i used to work food service and my manager at the time recommended i try defalco's;;;;
977;he knows food well so i was excited to try one of his favorites spots;;;;
978;this place is really really good;;;;
979;lot of authentic italian choices and they even have a grocery section with tons of legit italian goodies;;;;
980;i had a chicken parmigiana sandwich that was to die for;;;;
981;anytime my ex-manager comes back to town (he left for vegas and i think he misses defalco's more than anything else in the valley) he is sure to stop by and grab his favorite grub;;;;
982;parking is a bit tricky during busy hours and the wait times for food can get a bit long so i recommend calling your order ahead of time (unless you want to take a look around while you wait first-timers);;;;
983;early this past january i needed to find a furnished rental in the uptown charlotte market;;;;
984;i really had no idea of how or where to look;;;;
985;i was glad when i found the sold on charlotte site;;;;
986;as i recall i traded a few emails and phone calls with chip and he was helpful in answering all my questions;;;;
987;we met at 626 north graham and he showed me the unit there that was available;;;;
988;"between chip and sylvia i was ""sold"" on that apartment and we got the ""paperwork"" going";;;;
989;i enjoyed my stay there which lasted 6 months (3 months more that i initially signed up for);;;;
990;when it came time to give my notice sylvia gave me all the details i needed and these were pretty much the same that were in our initial lease agreement;;;;
991;they were kind enough to give me ample notice to show the apartment during my last 30 days without too much inconvenience;;;;
992;sylvia helped me tie up a few loose ends and even arranged to pick up a lamp for me that needed to be repaired when i moved out;;;;
993;i would certainly reach out to the team at sold on charlotte again;;;;
994;kind regards,;;;;
995;john d;;;;
996;i really enjoyed coming here it located near walnut st which meant parking was difficult;;;;
997;what i didn't realized was that hot pots where individualized;;;;
998;they gave a pot over an electric hot plate which you can adjust the temp;;;;
999;they also have hot water on the side in case you run out;;;;
1000;very fulfilling for $15;;;;
1001;it's a small area and they also have a section for you to customize your own sauces;;;;
1002;ok so i have purchased items from rc wiley and have spent a lot of money but will never again;;;;
1003;i had a $500 credit limit after i purchased my fridge and when  iwent to use it towards ny bed room purchase it was no longer available due to me paying it off too soon????? (apparently since i paid $500 in 2months instead of $25 in 10 months) when we attempted to question what they meant and if there was anything that couldbe done the supervisor emele pretty much told us to take a flying leap -are you serious!!  so i spent my $2300 at ashley furniture;;;;
1004;rc wiley apparently is balling and they don't need me to buy anything;;;;
1005;good luck! when u have poor customer service reps representing you like that their making your company look bad;;;;
1006;let me start by saying that i love aveda which is why i decided to try this salon;;;;
1007;and it was a big mistake;;;;
1008;i explained what i wanted to the stylist and even showed two photos;;;;
1009;it's easy to get this cut wrong since it's short hair so i also showed a photo of what exactly i did not want;;;;
1010;she asked what i didn't like about the photo and i explained it (it's a section in the back and she acted like she understood);;;;
1011;the cut finishes she spins me around and it is literally exactly what i showed her that i didn't want;;;;
1012;i was mortified and now trying to grow this hideous cut out;;;;
1013;nothing is blended and she butchered my hair;;;;
1014;and to make matters worse she wasn't even friendly! heading to a different salon today to try and get it fixed;;;;
1015;place took forever;;;;
1016;come to find out that they didn't have my oil filter and a hour and a half into me waiting the napa parts guy pulls up and 10 mins later it was done;;;;
1017;hmmm;;;;
1018;but they didn't even let me know what was going on! never going back;;;;
1019;cutest little dive bar in the city! chill vibe cheap (and yummy) drinks delicious food and family owned;;;;
1020;laura was an excellent bartender and made us feel right at home;;;;
1021;bonus points because it looks like a cute little house! a must-see if you're in the area;;;;
1022;really happy to have such a unique place like this in phoenix;;;;
1023;the tea was tasty and the interior is very well laid out;;;;
1024;will definitely come back!;;;;
1025;these darn northerners really know how to make some goooood eggplant;;;;
1026;i am obsessed like seriously obsessed with their eggplant minced pork dish;;;;
1027;it sounds so simple but never have i had it this good;;;;
1028;everything else on the menu is decent the dumplings xlb noodles etc;;;;
1029;but the eggplant is to die for! go for the authentic side of the menu avoid the americanized dishes;;;;
1030;the few times i ordered from here i was greatly disappointed;;;;
1031;freezer burned strawberry ice cream microwaved food and run of the mill breakfast;;;;
1032;we have had a wonderful experience with dr;;;;
1033;beals treating our son;;;;
1034;he's been seeing him for about 8 months now and are very satisfied with the care he receives here;;;;
1035;beals is very helpful we never feel rushed to get out of his office and he's patient in answering our questions;;;;
1036;one of the things i most appreciate is that i've never felt like his solution is to throw a bunch of meds at my son;;;;
1037;he's conservative and has started on low doses moving up only when we were comfortable;;;;
1038;my son loves coming to the appointments and playing with all the minecraft toys in his office!;;;;
1039;just ok;;;;
1040;not a fun true busy dim sum place and i'm so sure they don't make their own food;;;;
1041;won't be back soon;;;;
1042;i've been coming to loco on mill since they opened;;;;
1043;i love coming here especially on sundays for football;;;;
1044;they have all the games on great bloodys and awesome breakfast!  loco is my local watering hole and i always have a great time with the staff;;;;
1045;ordered combo 3;;;;
1046;it comes with two plates or rice (or bread) one skewer of chicken breast kebob one skewer of koobideh one skewer of barg kebob 3 grilled tomatoes a plate of parsley and sliced radish a bunch of basil;;;;
1047;no salad;;;;
1048;the meat were all very flavourful not dry and juicy!!! the taste was very good;;;;
1049;definitely a lot of food for two people;;;;
1050;the waitress was very friendly and attentive;;;;
1051;i read another review that they do not accept amex and yeah they really don't;;;;
1052;but i asked before i paid for the meal so it's ok;;;;
1053;rebel doesn't take credit cards and charges you to use debit;;;;
1054;not very convenient for people going to the lake;;;;
1055;we will just fill up elsewhere;;;;
1056;the place is filthy too;;;;
1057;the decor and everything int he restaurant is really nice and sheik looking;;;;
1058;we got the resting panda and the whiskey sour both of which were very tasting drinks;;;;
1059;we started with the foo foo plater (just to be able to try a bit of everything);;;;
1060;it was pretty good actually i'd highly recommend it! our server (i believe her name was nicky) was super awesome and really nice and helpful;;;;
1061;she decided on getting the pork belly ramen and two sushi rolls;;;;
1062;the ramen was good a little salty but i'd recommend it;;;;
1063;then we received the spider roll which was great;;;;
1064;next up was the crispy roll which was where the problems arose;;;;
1065;we had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll;;;;
1066;after about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long;;;;
1067;apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long;;;;
1068;i myself am a server and although the server came over and apologized several times it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize;;;;
1069;we finally got it and it was okay and they ended up comping it which was nice;;;;
1070;i'd give this place one more try;;;;
1071;but i most limey wouldn't order the crispy rice roll again;;;;
1072;hey;;;;
1073;i just want to say everytime i eat here since the late 90's;;;;
1074;nothing but good wings good beer and good times;;;;
1075;if the waiting staff is terrible slow non attentive so be it;;;;
1076;i eventually get my food and beer im busy either catching up with friends or pull out the cell phone and chat with friends;;;;
1077;weird but there it is;;;;
1078;have fun here;;;;
1079;cheers!;;;;
1080;while the prices are a bit high for a make-your-own pizza the taste makes up for it;;;;
1081;i love going to seventh street market sitting not just coffee and having a drink while waiting for delicious fresh made pizza from pure;;;;
1082;i've taken this to go as well as eaten inside the market and i can say that the pizza doesn't do well reheated;;;;
1083;so try to eat it fresh while there if possible;;;;
1084;if one of their specialty pizzas sounds good to you go for it as those are definitely a better deal for the amount of toppings you get for the money;;;;
1085;i wanted what i wanted though so i ended up with a medium thin crust regular crust pizza with jalapenos pepperoncini onions and feta;;;;
1086;it was pretty expensive at $2/topping = $20 med pizza;;;;
1087;but it was delicious;;;;
1088;the arugula salad with goat cheese and lemon vinaigrette is to-die-for;;;;
1089;i crave that dressing days later;;;;
1090;so light and fresh but flavorful;;;;
1091;visited this restaurant after a 3 hour drive to get to it;;;;
1092;we my boyfriend and i  saw their ad on their website for an $$85 per couple valentine's day dinner;;;;
1093;we had reservations for 6p;;;;
1094;this reservation was made on friday we dined on saturday;;;;
1095;when we arrived right at 6p;;;;
1096;there were plenty of open tables in the restaurant;;;;
1097;when the hostess looked for our name on the reservation list it showed we were to be sat at table 14;;;;
1098;the list said in large print at the top;;;;
1099;do not change tables;;;;
1100;the hostess walked us past 8 - 10 2 person tables to sit us at a 2 person table literally 6inches from the neighboring table!  could we have asked to sit elsewhere? apparently not as the hostess was under direct orders not to change tables;;;;
1101;could we have dined elsewhere;;;;
1102;probably not considering it is valentines weekend and we drove 3 hours to get there and have no reservations any where else and no idea at 6p;;;;
1103;where to go;;;;
1104;so we sat;;;;
1105;we could hear every word the table next to us said;;;;
1106;"(which by the way when you take your pregnant wife out for valentine's day you probably shouldn't answer the phone when your buddies call or talk about how ""hot"" her female coworker is";;;;
1107;)  this was so awkward you had to watch every word you said to be sure the neighboring diners weren't eavesdropping on personal info;;;;
1108;"most uncomfortable ""romantic"" evening of my life";;;;
1109;now to the food;;;;
1110;"the valentine's day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before) a ""salad"" choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the new zealand rack of lamb because it too sold out the night before";;;;
1111;) a chocolate creme brulet to share for dessert and a bottle of nero d'avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine);;;;
1112;we ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special;;;;
1113;the soup - lobster bisque (delicious) and minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized;;;;
1114;it was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it);;;;
1115;however it did taste quite nice;;;;
1116;the appetizer - artichokes with prosciutto;;;;
1117;yummo!;;;;
1118;the salad - hmm not what i had in mind;;;;
1119;a tiny plate of feta cheese cucumber pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else;;;;
1120;but not a traditional salad;;;;
1121;so beware!  taste was great but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings;;;;
1122;this it is not;;;;
1123;the meal - veal with shrimp and gnocchi;;;;
1124;quite pleasing to the palette;;;;
1125;the dessert - chocolate creme brulet;;;;
1126;umm not so much;;;;
1127;it was quite clearly 3/4 cup of chocolate mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart;;;;
1128;yes it did taste good however;;;;
1129;where was the creme brulet the waiter raved about?;;;;
1130;the wine - nero d'avola;;;;
1131;yes i am a red wine drinker the wine was delicious;;;;
1132;but upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room;;;;
1133;found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle;;;;
1134;why the lie? we would have ordered the special anyway;;;;
1135;the atmosphere;;;;
1136;beautiful romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and christmas lights through out;;;;
1137;they had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it since as you know we dress up not dress warm when going out to dinner;;;;
1138;the place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down;;;;
1139;the manager  chose to turn the fireplace off even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage;;;;
1140;by the time i left my toes were frozen;;;;
1141;we finished eating and paid for the bill at 7;;;;
1142;50p;;;;
1143;i turned around and noticed four empty 2 person tables;;;;
1144;they had never been sat but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple!;;;;
1145;upon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening;;;;
1146;would i go back when in town again? no;;;;
1147;at the risk of being sat in that situation again;;;;
1148;the food can be the most delicious in the world but i still prefer and deserve privacy when dining;;;;
1149;and to the lady we sat next to;;;;
1150;good luck on your birth maybe your dislike for cheese will go away after you give birth;;;;
1151;not sure why some posted negative reviews of this place because it is on point;;;;
1152;my girlfriend and i had dinner there last night with reservations set for 6 p;;;;
1153;were seated by 6;;;;
1154;our server william was awesome was fast attentative and really was one of the best servers we've encountered and we dine out a lot;;;;
1155;we both ordered all you can eat crab legs and they were fresh hot and delicious;;;;
1156;i do feel the sticker price was high but we must have had 5 buckets each so it equates to 10 bucks a pound;;;;
1157;the only negative i did feel could be addressed is the tables are made of some type of epoxy resin so being outside may be melting or something because there was a sticky residue on the table top;;;;
1158;i just played a napkin over it so it was acceptable;;;;
1159;my girlfriend and i will definitely be returning to pickle bills we had a fantastic evening;;;;
1160;last thing to note the service was great even though the place was packed!;;;;
1161;after being a huge fan of the mission i decided to try this place out seeing that it's owned by the same owners even though i was very skeptical that it could possibly be as great;;;;
1162;to my surprise it lived up to what others had told me;;;;
1163;the ambiance was amazing;;;;
1164;very much like the mission;;;;
1165;candles light up the entire place;;;;
1166;the outside patio is quite large and there is a lot of seating available;;;;
1167;the staff was great and very helpful with making suggestions on the menu;;;;
1168;my favorite items on the menu are the scallops and the apple caramel upside down cake;;;;
1169;they were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth;;;;
1170;they have a great wine list and its a perfect setting to enjoy a few glasses of wine;;;;
1171;) this is a great date night spot that i recommend it now to all my friends;;;;
1172;i've tried to shop at montblanc toronto several times but the selection is very limited and the sales staff while attentive not very friendly;;;;
1173;recently i tried to replace a ring i received as a gift and lost;;;;
1174;the toronto store was quick to identify the style number of the ring but said they no longer had stock and couldn't help me i asked them if they could check other locations with no avail;;;;
1175;because the ring had a lot of sentimental value i decided to call the  hong kong location where the ring was purchased;;;;
1176;over the phone the clerk jane and amazing representative knew the ring as well and again it was out of stock but she offered to check with head office in to see if any exist  at any location world wide;;;;
1177;she called me the next day from hong kong to inform me she found the last ring in london and it was now in transit to her store where she would hold it for me until i return to hong kong in a few months;;;;
1178;not wanting to risk the ring getting sold or lost i paid for it with my credit card over the phone and arranged for a friend to pick it up and send it by courier;;;;
1179;the ring now sits on my finger never to be removed again;;;;
1180;this is the type of service that builds loyalty;;;;
1181;the montblanc store in hong kong is located in pacific mall;;;;
1182;jane has since been promoted and transferred to their flagship store on kowloon side on canton road;;;;
1183;i'm not surprised of her promotion given the service she provided me;;;;
1184;i will be forever be loyal to the hong kong location;;;;
1185;thanks jane!  i'm giving 2 stars to the toronto location the hong kong location would easily have 5 stars;;;;
1186;trã¨s bon poulet avec la petite sauce piquante c'est succulent;;;;
1187;beaucoup trop de frite dans les assiettes;;;;
1188;il n'y a pratiquement pas de place dans l'ã©tablissement et il faut souvent faire la file pour commander;;;;
1189;mieux vaut prendre en take out;;;;
1190;jai pas goã»ter ã  la poutine mais ã§a va l'air intense;;;;
1191;j'ai eu envie de donner trois ã©toiles ã©tant donnã© la file et le peu de place  mais ã©tant donnã© qu'il s'agit d'une des meilleures rã´tisserie portugaise ( oublier l'infã¢me piri piri ) je lui en ai mis quatres;;;;
1192;best thai food ever! love the mango curry especially and everything;;;;
1193;they have great bubble tea too;;;;
1194;very nice service very polite;;;;
1195;we've shopped there for several years and always enjoyed the savings but this year i'm shopping for hoodies for the less fortunate;;;;
1196;thank you antigua;;;;
1197;what an awesome pool party!!! i wish there was a tad more interactive aspects;;;;
1198;i want hot girls and guys spraying champagne all over us or dancing with us;;;;
1199;i love this place! i have found the staff to be extremely knowledgable beyond helpful and always willing to go above and beyond to do whatever they can to assist you;;;;
1200;this store carries products that i can't find anywhere else besides online;;;;
1201;they are great about returns if you have a finicky eater (like mine);;;;
1202;i also love that they have no agenda when it comes to helping you select a certain food;;;;
1203;they listen to what you're looking for and then make suggestions based on the info you've given them;;;;
1204;they're also well versed in the latest pet food recalls (which are hard to stay on top of these days!);;;;
1205;if you sign up online they offer discounts and specials all the time which helps with some of the pricier food;;;;
1206;organized clean and a huge selection;;;;
1207;i have absolutely no complaints about this place;;;;
1208;except maybe that when they hold weekend pet adoptions i get depressed that i can't take all the animals home;;;;
1209;i just had a terrible experience with dr;;;;
1210;jennifer vonya-novak's front office;;;;
1211;i changed my primary care to dr;;;;
1212;novak;;;;
1213;it took me 3 weeks to get an appointment because she only does 4 new patients a day;;;;
1214;i waited the 3 weeks for what i was told was a 7;;;;
1215;45 am appt;;;;
1216;i got to her office at 7;;;;
1217;45 (actually 7;;;;
1218;47 am according to my cell phone);;;;
1219;the door was locked and the office hours posted were 8;;;;
1220;00- to 5;;;;
1221;i could see through the glass doors that there wasn't anyone at the desk area;;;;
1222;l left ,went home and called a 8 am no answer;;;;
1223;called again at 8;;;;
1224;10 and the lady said i missed my appointment and could not be seen today;;;;
1225;she argued that the door is always open at 7;;;;
1226;"she was unapologetic and offered me a next day appointment like she was doing me a favor since i ""missed"" my appointment";;;;
1227;"she kept calling me ""my dear"" as if i was incapable of knowing the appointment time";;;;
1228;i found her very condescending;;;;
1229;needless to say i will not be going to dr;;;;
1230;novak and will let my friends know the office procedures there and the unbendable and arrogant rules!;;;;
1231;i love pizza but i try to stay away for dietary reasons;;;;
1232;i went here last week with my daughter and mom and was pleasantly surprised;;;;
1233;thin crust new york style pizza at a good price;;;;
1234;the menu is kind of simple but that's the way these places are nowadays;;;;
1235;friendly staff and clean simple surroundings;;;;
1236;was very excited for happy hour and heard great things;;;;
1237;food was less then average we were charged $10 for bread;;;;
1238;most apps were greasy or fried and still spent $250 on happy hour menu for a group of 4;;;;
1239;first review on yelp so cared enough to take the time to write this;;;;
1240;sorry won't come back;;;;
1241;excellent shortbread;;;;
1242;koodos to ms;;;;
1243;mary and her oh so good chocolate crunch shortbread cookies;;;;
1244;my family and i came in on wed;;;;
1245;night for dinner we had a party of 6 plus a baby(using a high chair);;;;
1246;we had to wait about 10 mins to be seated and when we got to our table it was against the wall half booth half chairs;;;;
1247;"my husband asked to sit at another table but the hostess said ""no"" so we had the baby between our table and the customers next to us luckily she's a great baby!! the table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky gross and i had to kick a fork out from under my seat";;;;
1248;the service was subpar but the waiter was nice;;;;
1249;it took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills well they were sparse to say the least;;;;
1250;i ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they what i believe microwaved it to warm it up;;;;
1251;my poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced;;;;
1252;the worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger;;;;
1253;my husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back;;;;
1254;the waiter's solution for the inconvenience was a free appetizer card to be redeemed the next time they came in;;;;
1255;we live 3 1/2 hours from mesa and it's so disappointing to run into this kind of service this was definitely not a pleasant experience;;;;
1256;five stars! i highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for authentic latin american cuisine;;;;
1257;coming from someone raised in latin america i'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have latin american food because although the dishes try to imitate latin american styles they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be;;;;
1258;however chica completely nailed it;;;;
1259;the whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well;;;;
1260;the mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home;;;;
1261;besides that the latin music was on point and the cocktails were great too!;;;;
1262;oooh momma!;;;;
1263;the flavor is strong with this one;;;;
1264;clean fast friendly everytime;;;;
1265;but not weird and sterile like baja fresh;;;;
1266;glad they're open again!;;;;
1267;lk is a great technician! he makes you feel relaxed and comfortable as well as being extremely attentive to your nails;;;;
1268;gosh;;;;
1269;i'm not going to write much except that it was delicious;;;;
1270;i came here because of all the reviews and seriously it was worth the drive;;;;
1271;i had the spring rolls and those were delicious;;;;
1272;then i had the noodle ye-saw with shrimp;;;;
1273;and i pretty much licked my plate;;;;
1274;and all the plates going by looked better and better;;;;
1275;i'm already planning the next time i come here;;;;
1276;and my server was a sweet sweet girl;;;;
1277;soft spoken but just the perfect server;;;;
1278;i'd take a picture of my food but i dove in and cleaned my plate;;;;
1279;lol;;;;
1280;oh well;;;;
1281;there are 254 pics for you to choose from;;;;
1282;fresh food tasty and amazing service are the 3 characteristics that come to my mind when thinking about this place;;;;
1283;however price is a big downside;;;;
1284;went there on a tuesday night did not have to wait for a table and service was quick and the staff was very friendly;;;;
1285;the menu options are pretty limited but definitely focused on providing the most typical portuguese experience;;;;
1286;one major downside;;;;
1287;the food portions are extremely small for the price you pay;;;;
1288;the value for money clearly isn't fair considering they are dishes tapas style;;;;
1289;in a regular restaurant you'd get real size dishes for the price you pay for tapas there;;;;
1290;2 mini starters 2 entrees (tapas style) shared + 1 desert with one glass of wine gave us a $90 bill and we left without feeling full;;;;
1291;the desert was a caramel fondant with pear ice cream probably the only thing we ate that was so incredible we would have paid twice the price for;;;;
1292;otherwise it was too pricy;;;;
1293;i will definitely go back once they revise their price!;;;;
1294;amazing!!! clean and pretty! best service i've been in las vegas! everyone are so nice! and all the design are perfect;;;;
1295;amazing place full of authentic decor and ambiance! papaya salad is so refreshing and full of flavor;;;;
1296;combination pad thai with pork beef and shrimp is enough for two meals;;;;
1297;thai toasts for an appetizer consists if minced chicken and shrimp baked on toast served with cucumber salad;;;;
1298;it us a must try!!;;;;
1299;i'm not that pleased with this experience;;;;
1300;for the price i expected better ambiance and better presentation;;;;
1301;the steaks were seasoned and cooked well;;;;
1302;our family enjoys a good cut that's perfectly done to each person's speculations;;;;
1303;also the service was perfect;;;;
1304;our server was thoughtful and attentive without overly interrupting when we didn't need anything;;;;
1305;however for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive more fancy not so loud;;;;
1306;it felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment;;;;
1307;we had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (sunday evening);;;;
1308;the plates were also nothing special to look at;;;;
1309;again because of the price we expected a few frills;;;;
1310;the meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates;;;;
1311;no effort was put into the presentation;;;;
1312;even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic;;;;
1313;probably won't return;;;;
1314;if i'm paying this much i'd like to feel a little more pampered;;;;
1315;i work at wells fargo right next door to rubio's on 24th st and baseline and out main goal is too satisfy the customers using our vision and values;;;;
1316;that being said rubios is so relative because everyday i go to rubios for lunch they make me feel at home and like a valued customer by showing quality service and going over and beyond the standard for me! they don't sale chimichangas but the manager george and the great cooks took it upon themselves to fry my burrito for me! george is a great leader and represents that franchise at a high level! last but not least priscilla the shift leader lights up the whole room with her smile as soon as you are opening the door as well delivering excellent service! thanks rubios - da'quon  #yourbankteller;;;;
1317;wiki wiki is like the middle ground from your typical gas station auto wash and full service washes with the personal touch;;;;
1318;you start out by ordering your service at one of 3 electronic kiosks;;;;
1319;everything is touch screen;;;;
1320;they give you 4 choices but then they suggest additional upgrades to your wash;;;;
1321;you pay and then move on to the wash;;;;
1322;someone assists you in getting your car lined up in the track;;;;
1323;put your car in neutral and in a few minutes your car moves through the wash and you come out the other end;;;;
1324;when you come out you have the option of using one of several free vacuum which are powerful;;;;
1325;this is a great alternative to the full service places;;;;
1326;it's quicker and you don't have to wait for someone to towel dry your car;;;;
1327;please;;;;
1328;read this before you buy a session with her;;;;
1329;about a year ago i bought a groupon here and having a horrible experience i've never used groupon for services again;;;;
1330;you get what you pay for - and in this case less;;;;
1331;lesson learned;;;;
1332;she uses clumps of lashes that fall off within 12 hours;;;;
1333;your eyes will also be completely bloodshot from whatever glue she uses;;;;
1334;i let her know and even sent pictures of my eyes because they were so red and painful i thought they were infected;;;;
1335;"she blamed it on me and offered to ""fix"" them for more money";;;;
1336;i declined - there was no way i was letting her do any more damage;;;;
1337;i have had my lashes done before and since with professionals and have never had that happen;;;;
1338;i love the lash service at wishful winking and the spot in liberty village;;;;
1339;icing on the badlashes cake;;;;
1340;she was over an hour and a half late for my apt and claimed it was never booked;;;;
1341;even when i showed her the text she had sent me with the confirmation;;;;
1342;the whole time i was waiting my gut was yelling no and i should have listened;;;;
1343;just no;;;;
1344;we used creative bridal for our vegas wedding at mgm grand as part of our wedding package;;;;
1345;originally it was only to get my husband tuxedo for the wedding;;;;
1346;unfortunately my wedding dress from david's had an alteration issue and the back of my dress ripped when i was finally trying it on for the last time the day before the wedding;;;;
1347;since we were on our way to get a tux fitting for my husband he thought it would be best to ask them if they can help us fix it because i was in tears since the dress was ripped so bad that my butt was hanging out;;;;
1348;britney picked us up at mgm and brought us and during conversation she did say let's look at the dress and see what can be done;;;;
1349;kelly and brittany did just that they quickly placed me in my dress while taisha took my husband in to get his tux fitted;;;;
1350;all while making sure he didn't see me;;;;
1351;i'm so grateful for all three ladies! i highly recommend them! (sorry if i got anyone names wrong);;;;
1352;well they definitely lost me as a customer! rc willey here i come!;;;;
1353;my father who is 69 years old moved out here from los angeles the beginning of this month to be closer to me and my kids;;;;
1354;i ordered and fully paid for a bedroom set for him;;;;
1355;they called me like 4 days before the order was to be delivered to confirm the appointment;;;;
1356;i advised the lady that no one was living in my father's apartment yet but if they could call me as they are on their way i could rush down to the place and open the door for them;;;;
1357;i mean i live in the same complex so it wouldn't be a long wait! she said she would let the guys know but no promise;;;;
1358;okaaaaay? i paid $1,200 for furniture i am a repeat customer and you can't make one quick easy courtesy call? well i missed their delivery and no call was made;;;;
1359;i found out from my landlord that they came because they went to the office and he was going to let them in but they said no because someone had to sign the paper;;;;
1360;"to top it off when i got my dad's key to check the place out before he arrived there was a note on the counter that said ""sorry we missed you""";;;;
1361;so they entered the apartment and left the note but couldn't put the damn furniture together?? they denied going in but how the hell did the paper get on the counter? anyway my dad arrived with no furniture and we had to pay $50;;;;
1362;00 for them to deliver the furniture again 3 days later;;;;
1363;my father has bad arthritis and basically no cartilage in his knees making it very hard for him to get up from low areas such as couches and floors which he almost had to sleep on if it weren't for my friend who let us borrow her air mattress luckily;;;;
1364;he still couldn't get up though and crawled to get around his place until i was able to get to his place after work;;;;
1365;bottom line they are not for their customers at all and their attitude after you purchase their crap shows it all;;;;
1366;i will never be back;;;;
1367;i have been getting monthly massages here for the past five months;;;;
1368;a couple of the therapists are good and some lack experience;;;;
1369;as a stocking stuffer for my husband i scheduled an appointment for him to meet with roberta a very capable therapist;;;;
1370;when he arrived for his appointment his name did not show on the schedule;;;;
1371;yet the gentleman working the front desk clearly remembered scheduling that appointment with me;;;;
1372;he blamed it on glitchy new scheduling software;;;;
1373;i was extremely disappointed and embarrassed since it was a gift;;;;
1374;but what else could we do but reschedule? an appointment was set again with roberta through the same desk attendant for this afternoon;;;;
1375;when my husband arrived this afternoon he was placed with a different therapist who confessed that she did not know how to work with his specific shoulder issue;;;;
1376;so he again rescheduled;;;;
1377;this is getting ridiculous and i'm considering canceling my membership over it;;;;
1378;i've been here 2x wasn't impressed the first time figured give them a second try;;;;
1379;there latte doesn't impress me i'd rather goto the starbucks adjacent to this spot;;;;
1380;a toned down version of the king street location gotstyle is a great store primarily for the service you receive;;;;
1381;it's definitely not for everyone - there is a price tag attached;;;;
1382;but if you shop at places like holt renfrew or even the bay then this place is considerably better in my opinion;;;;
1383;the reason - the sales agents are just better;;;;
1384;they have pretty good sales twice a year which is when i tend to go but sizing is obviously an issue at those times;;;;
1385;i appreciate that they carry various price points in the mid to high range;;;;
1386;overall i wouldn't get my formal wear from here;;;;
1387;that's just me personally;;;;
1388;i'd rather go to the u;;;;
1389;and pay half the price for the same quality;;;;
1390;but if you can't do that they have an excellent selection and great tailors;;;;
1391;you can find cheaper tailors in toronto but at least at gotstyle you don't have to go through the hassle of finding the right tailer;;;;
1392;you can trust the store;;;;
1393;they have an excellent selection of casual clothing and interesting and cool clothing pieces too;;;;
1394;this is definitely a go to place if you're anything like me and don't know how to buy jeans;;;;
1395;my last visit at the store jannette spent a great deal of time educating my friend and i on how to dress;;;;
1396;we left the store uncharacteristically self aware of ourselves but really we learnt a great deal in the process;;;;
1397;their red velvet cupcakes are amazing! their buttercream frosting is fantastic and i also like their brownies when they have them;;;;
1398;the location couldn't be better;;;;
1399;i'd say you couldn't find a more romantic date-spot;;;;
1400;i won't give them 5 stars though since i have had some dry cupcakes in the past and they seem to always run out of the good stuff (mostly the red velvet) on weekends which is the only time i can make it over there;;;;
1401;i so disagree with a couple of the reviews i read;;;;
1402;dr miller is one of the best doctors i've ever seen and i've seen and worked with many as a medical professional;;;;
1403;she is very detailed and shows concern regarding all aspects of my health;;;;
1404;i have referred several people to her;;;;
1405;highly recommended!!!;;;;
1406;my experience went from bad to worse;;;;
1407;this place is filthy and the employees are extremely rude;;;;
1408;i pawned an item and when i went back to pick it up the place we closed;;;;
1409;i went back first thing in the morning to pick up the item;;;;
1410;i was told that the finance charge was double for being a day late;;;;
1411;i love this place;;;;
1412;lots of great healthy options;;;;
1413;excellent variety friendly staff no exorbitant prices;;;;
1414;doesn't beat being held by someone who cares about you but what does? enough melancholy from me;;;;
1415;go forth and eat healthy;;;;
1416;i've received great service and highly recommend stone law;;;;
1417;i've been a client for many years and can attest they do great work!;;;;
1418;they specialize in southern california-style food like burritos salsas and fish tacos;;;;
1419;the decor and ambiance is great;;;;
1420;the tables and bar stools exposed-brick wall modern light fixtures etc;;;;
1421;make for a classy and comfortable dining experience;;;;
1422;i saw a few craft beers and a respectable bourbon list;;;;
1423;however we did an early saturday morning breakfast which was fantastic;;;;
1424;the banana pancakes were unreal;;;;
1425;i normally stop here for breakfast when travelling through calgary international airport;;;;
1426;it is one of the few restaurants available once you pass security;;;;
1427;fare is ok for a decent breakfast and good coffee;;;;
1428;15 dollars for breakfast;;;;
1429;absolute waste of money;;;;
1430;my husband and i felt no different after using the oxygen bar massages and drinking the $5 peppermint drink;;;;
1431;the employee was very sweet but don't waste your money;;;;
1432;this place would get 1 star if the customer service sucked;;;;
1433;and they tell you it's $22 for the oxygen but they also charge $5 for the thing that goes in your nose;;;;
1434;the 5 for 6 'til 7 is so awesome and such a great deal! i wasn't sure the first time we went if we should dress up or if it was okay to wear jeans and a nice top but everyone was either in their business casual work clothes or jeans;;;;
1435;i would recommend getting there a little early because it fills up quickly! we got there at 6pm and by 7pm it was pretty full;;;;
1436;i have recommended this to so many of my co-workers and friends to try out and so far anyone that has gone has come back to me saying what a great time they had and how surprised they were with the 5 for 6 'til 7 deal;;;;
1437;it was my first time here and i was definitely;;;;
1438;impressed;;;;
1439;the groomers work and etiquette was lovely;;;;
1440;i usually need the works when it comes to my little schweenie mix;;;;
1441;) i'm glad i went to her and will most definitely be back!;;;;
1442;the only reason i'm even giving this place 2 stars is because of their food and drinks;;;;
1443;their service however is probably the worst i've ever had;;;;
1444;i used to (emphasis on the tense) go there every tuesday for trivia night (the guy hosting is awesome);;;;
1445;my service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named jess waited on us;;;;
1446;the rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat;;;;
1447;"when we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was ""going to be complicated or not";;;;
1448;""" she then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered";;;;
1449;it took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them to even bring that to her attention for which she didn't even apologize;;;;
1450;after 35mins and someone else bringing our food out we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders a task that was also messed up (i ordered their special of big ass margeritas to which i received a small mason jar of mostly ice);;;;
1451;they told me it'd be free but it honestly wasn't even worth that;;;;
1452;after that the only time i saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress;;;;
1453;completely unprofessional;;;;
1454;a different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too;;;;
1455;i had this same waitress the tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service;;;;
1456;that's when i realized that it wasn't just a bad or busy night (it was a tuesday for crying out loud) but that this woman is just really bad at customer service;;;;
1457;definitely do not recommend going there!!! don't know exactly which was our original waitress but our checks said joanne g;;;;
1458;will also be posting my experience on your facebook in hopes that you get better trained and caring staff;;;;
1459;i've been here a couple of times by recommendation from a korean friend;;;;
1460;the jjamppong and jjajangmyun are very delicious;;;;
1461;it's even better when they're cheaper on the special menu days (rotates every other day);;;;
1462;the portions are very generous;;;;
1463;i usually share 1 dish with my friend;;;;
1464;it's $5;;;;
1465;00 (jjajangmyun - tues,thurs sat sun) and $6;;;;
1466;99 (jjamppong - mon wed fri);;;;
1467;however i was a bit surprised at their dish with the steamed buns (i think it's kochu japchae);;;;
1468;it was super pricey!!! that dish alone was $20;;;;
1469;99 on the special;;;;
1470;very little meat mostly peppers and some other veggies;;;;
1471;i'm guessing the expensive part was the steamed buns;;;;
1472;'cause those looked really intricately made;;;;
1473;i think there are actually several pricey dishes they serve on their menu;;;;
1474;i'll just stick to the affordable menu items;;;;
1475;in general i really like their dishes (jjamppong and jjajangmyun) and their service is friendly but i don't think i can come here without my korean friend;;;;
1476;it seems like the servers don't speak english and there is no translated menu;;;;
1477;horrible experience i went in to get a full set french tips the guy who did them was very rude never said a word only yanked at my hand he cut my real nails after i told him not to;;;;
1478;i complained about bubbles and dust inside the acrylic they acted like they couldn't see it;;;;
1479;two days later my nails are lifting and more bubbles appeared;;;;
1480;i will never go here again and hope others don't waste their time or money at this place;;;;
1481;driving more than an half-hour to get to a gun range was getting old;;;;
1482;i was so happy to see this range open up in cornelius;;;;
1483;they have all the amenities that you would expect a range to have for modern shooters;;;;
1484;i come here for recreational purposes and have found the range more than suitable;;;;
1485;they have fully electronic systems and the lanes are wide and not tight like many other ranges;;;;
1486;they also offer memberships that are competitive to some of the other ranges around the area;;;;
1487;daily lane rates are a bit pricy but considering their location they can charge that much;;;;
1488;however stray away from the touristic prices for weapons and ammo;;;;
1489;there are many other stores that just sell and you'll want to visit those;;;;
1490;the prices they quoted me were $200 more than several other stores and i just couldn't bite that bullet;;;;
1491;come here for the range and range only;;;;
1492;also don't believe when they say they will give you a credit for unsatisfactory meal because for some reason they have a tendency to forget they said it;;;;
1493;they no longer have to worry about my business;;;;
1494;we stopped by for a little shopping;;;;
1495;the mall is nicer than most and has plenty of stores;;;;
1496;it was a nice way to spend a few hours before heading on to another adventure;;;;
1497;i hope that every person who follows me everyone i know and anyone contemplating this establishment reads this first and never bothers to give this place with the crappiest staff of all time a second thought;;;;
1498;earlier today my friend and i dropped in to grab some lunch;;;;
1499;the staff either all lost their dogs this morning or just have the absolute worst attitudes you've ever seen in human beings;;;;
1500;not only was the nasty woman who served me avoiding any type of pleasantry but she was yelling across two other workers and a line of patrons asking what i wanted from the other end of the shop;;;;
1501;"when i asked the server for lettuce onion and roasted red peppers on my sandwich she quite literally moaned very loud and followed it with yelling ""ughhhhh god help me!"" before adding my toppings to my turkey sandwich";;;;
1502;"when one of the other servers asked us if our food was for ""here or to go"" the original server says aloudly ""to-go hopefully!!!"" wtf";;;;
1503;i'd love to know who this terrible human being thinks she is! i found my jaw on the floor more than once wondered why she thought i was such a headache and my friend and i decided right there that we would never return nor would we let this review go untold to everyone we know!! i feel the owners somehow have to be to blame! how the hell do you allow someone so miserable represent your livelihood? you don't expect livelihood for very much longer that's how;;;;
1504;"maybe this server will look a little less ""i just woke up"" at her next job";;;;
1505;cafe maya the newest coffee shop in this location;;;;
1506;not too much has changed although the inside seems a bit more spacious and cozy;;;;
1507;they offer all of your typical coffee drinks and prices are reasonable;;;;
1508;they have a couch and a large chair as well as around 10 wooden tables with chairs;;;;
1509;they offer a food menu for breakfast and lunch but not dinner;;;;
1510;they also have a rewards punch card for loyal customers;;;;
1511;this place is usually pretty quiet and chill and not too busy so a good place to go for some casual studying;;;;
1512;there is no parking lot so you have to hope to find a street parking spot available nearby which is the main limitation if you are driving;;;;
1513;overall a nice little coffee shop;;;;
1514;unbelievable experience start to finish;;;;
1515;we had a reservation for 9pm saturday;;;;
1516;when we arrived our table wasn't ready yet but the host asked if we wanted drinks and took our drink orders;;;;
1517;there is no drink menu here - the staff is the drink menu- which was nice;;;;
1518;everyone is very knowledgeable and quick with recommendations;;;;
1519;our party was big so we were seated outside on the patio which was enclosed and heated;;;;
1520;the menu changes a lot apparently and there is also a pretty big specials menu;;;;
1521;for apps we got oysters a sea urchin (from the specials menu) the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu) and the veal tartare;;;;
1522;everything was incredible and pairings were perfect;;;;
1523;for example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters;;;;
1524;for dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti;;;;
1525;the portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce bacon and huge lobster chunks;;;;
1526;each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster;;;;
1527;every wine pairing we tried was amazing;;;;
1528;unfortunately we had no room for dessert but the meal was definitely above out expectations;;;;
1529;expect to be here for a while;;;;
1530;our reservation was at 9 and we only finished eating at 11;;;;
1531;37- and we're not slow eaters;;;;
1532;i think the wait had to do with our party being big and the rest of the place being packed;;;;
1533;wild every night! my favorite place hands-down in az! the night life here is contagious and iv never been disappointed with there sunday fun day! every sunday they have a corn hole competition and crazy drink specials like penny refills!! you also have to try there duck and pork tacos or there hefe hamburger! my favorite margarita on the menu is the la chica flaca;;;;
1534;if you want a fun place to get lunch and a few drinks or looking to go crazy night this is the spot;;;;
1535;the reason that i'm giving scallywags 3 stars isn't for the food it's for the fact that this is what it is;;;;
1536;a drinking hole that shows the games on the telly & not for a meal;;;;
1537;we went to see england play in the euro 2012 and it was fun! everyone was totally into it;;;;
1538;**this place is to have a beer & watch the game not for eating**;;;;
1539;service was amazing christina was extremely tentative and took care of our whole group;;;;
1540;asked about splitting checks from the beginning which for a large group is very convenient!;;;;
1541;right off the bat i need to tell you that i love thrift store shopping;;;;
1542;adore it;;;;
1543;occasionally have sultry dreams about it;;;;
1544;okay we'll stop there;;;;
1545;savers is the heaven and hell of las vegas thrift stores;;;;
1546;you have to be willing to get dirty to get on your knees and repent;;;;
1547;you have to suffer through repeated disapointments in order to achieve the nirvana of a true thrift store find;;;;
1548;first trip out - chewed up barbie dolls and incomplete board games;;;;
1549;second trip - a set of christmas lights marked for $2 more than at the walmart they same from;;;;
1550;but then on the third trip back there it is - the chimera;;;;
1551;the unicorn;;;;
1552;"the 36"" 1970's black velvet painting of two tigers in flagrante delicto";;;;
1553;the elvis cookie jar;;;;
1554;the wine cooler made out of an abandoned suit of armor;;;;
1555;the red leather michael jackson thriller jacket;;;;
1556;a bronze toreador sculpture;;;;
1557;and it's only $12;;;;
1558;ah- thrift-gasm;;;;
1559;thank you savers;;;;
1560;i'll see you next week;;;;
1561;the gang at sun valley stereo is definitely top notch;;;;
1562;ryan gets right to the point and saw what i was interested in and we worked together to verify that all the parts were in to upgrade my 2004 rx-8 with a pioneer 4000nex touchscreen and back-up camera before i drove 90 minutes for the work;;;;
1563;when i first left there was some adjustments needed;;;;
1564;they took me back in without hesitation and made everything right;;;;
1565;the installer was committed to treating my car like it was his own;;;;
1566;he took the extra steps to make it all right and even fixed the hatch door to my 12-volt socket;;;;
1567;now that's going the extra mile! 6-stars!;;;;
1568;my family and i have been visiting this location since it opened;;;;
1569;can't really remember the year now;;;;
1570;although several of the reviews have to do with bad customer service i have found that it's definitely a staff turnaround issue;;;;
1571;we go often during the summers and well all year round actually;;;;
1572;lol;;;;
1573;it's never too cold to get ice cream in az am i right?????;;;;
1574;anywho the ice cream is always yummy and the experience of the kids being able to run back and forth and back and forth trying new flavors or deciding which one to pick it's always fun!;;;;
1575;sadly the smiling faces might not always be there but thankfully we always have a smile on our face that transfers to them weather the staff likes it or not;;;;
1576;lol;;;;
1577;i have been there for 5 different tattoos now and could not be happier with the work done;;;;
1578;my artist has been eric r;;;;
1579;and he has always done an incredible job;;;;
1580;his attention to detail is second to none;;;;
1581;i have recommended to friends who have been incredibly pleased with the work done;;;;
1582;all the artists there are friendly and make the experience that much better;;;;
1583;5 stars and then some;;;;
1584;highly recommend to anyone!;;;;
1585;you take the good you take the bad you take them both and there you have the facts of life;;;;
1586;at fieramosca;;;;
1587;(you are old like me if you know that theme song!);;;;
1588;have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  that was our experience;;;;
1589;some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped;;;;
1590;if you want a seat on the patio on friday or saturday in the summer make sure to reserve several days in advance;;;;
1591;reservations are taken by phone and i will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer;;;;
1592;i was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!;;;;
1593;being in a house transformed into a restaurant the entry hallway is narrow so if someone is going out nobody can go in and vice versa;;;;
1594;so if you are even a little claustrophobic  be warned you won't be comfortable here;;;;
1595;the food;;;;
1596;complimentary bruschetta;;;;
1597;a plain pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful;;;;
1598;go to la bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste;;;;
1599;caesar salad;;;;
1600;crispy romaine hints of fresh garlic and parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks;;;;
1601;bread basket;;;;
1602;now i know why the croutons are like rocks the crust on the bread was so hard i was worried i would break a tooth and i also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread when i was expecting crusty italian bread;;;;
1603;spaghetti carbonara;;;;
1604;the reason we came was because hubby was craving carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found fieramosca's version disappointingly bland even with extra parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper;;;;
1605;linguini di mamma ninetta;;;;
1606;i love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish;;;;
1607;with just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout and very little garlic flavour this dish was edible but far from great;;;;
1608;tiramisu;;;;
1609;no coffee flavour!  i have made tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and i know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream and these missed the coffee altogether and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream none of the yummy marscapone that i was expecting;;;;
1610;libretto's tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that fieramosca's lacked;;;;
1611;my favourite dessert when done well i left disappointed;;;;
1612;lemon sorbet;;;;
1613;frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon menu says imported from italy;;;;
1614;i actually liked it better than the sad face tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon he found an odd aftertaste;;;;
1615;i joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from italy but the truth is it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours;;;;
1616;thankfully she arrived as we had dessert so our entire meal was not ruined but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table;;;;
1617;ladies please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  ugh!;;;;
1618;dr - meh;;;;
1619;bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great which for the price was disappointing;;;;
1620;not worth a second visit;;;;
1621;2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good;;;;
1622;the search for pasta carbonara continues;;;;
1623;maybe a trip to nyc or even rome!;;;;
1624;please try this place;;;;
1625;the food is incredible and you can tell the people that run it are super-appreciative of everyone that comes through the door;;;;
1626;they are very proud of their food and they make sure to tell you it's all made in house - i;;;;
1627;no cans of anything;;;;
1628;the lady that served us must have significant influence on the food as she told me she is from mexico city so a lot of the food made is from the city's influence;;;;
1629;i told her i was visiting mc in january and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities;;;;
1630;the enchiladas i had were unlike any i've ever had;;;;
1631;perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? the chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla;;;;
1632;the two tortillas were sautã©ed in green chiles folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish;;;;
1633;it was then topped with lettuce chicken crema and all the other good stuff;;;;
1634;it was the best i've ever had;;;;
1635;i mean it;;;;
1636;warning;;;;
1637;when the dish indicates it's spicy it's spicy;;;;
1638;those were the spiciest enchiladas i've ever had but i appreciate the spice;;;;
1639;my gf however was fortunate in her decision to get the carnitas because she would have not been able to handle the enchiladas;;;;
1640;by the way the carnitas were excellent as well;;;;
1641;this place gets five stars and i can't wait to go back;;;;
1642;please please try this place;;;;
1643;it was empty when i walked in and that's a shame;;;;
1644;they should have a lot more business if it was all based on the quality of their food and service;;;;
1645;it's also very affordable;;;;
1646;chicken enchiladas were $9 and the carnitas were somewhere around there (maybe $12);;;;
1647;great environment i loved their meat jun;;;;
1648;very flavorful;;;;
1649;also they give side dishes which is definitely a bonus;;;;
1650;what a mess;;;;
1651;been in line over an hour and there are still about 10 people in front of me;;;;
1652;should've stuck with the company i usually use;;;;
1653;next counter or two over;;;;
1654;came here based on sw airlines suggestion and email;;;;
1655;ugh;;;;
1656;i don't normally say things are the best but these are the best fajitas i've ever had;;;;
1657;chips are perfect ,salsa is perfect bean dip is perfect and the best fried ice cream i've ever had;;;;
1658;plus the service is great;;;;
1659;great venue;;;;
1660;every seat in the house is awesome;;;;
1661;been here twice once for britney and another time for jlo;;;;
1662;both were fantastic performances;;;;
1663;sexy sultry and high energy! love love them and this venue!;;;;
1664;i did not visit the kent office but the office of dr;;;;
1665;brown in fairlawn;;;;
1666;she was lacking in compassion clarity kindness and professional ethics;;;;
1667;she judged me based on my  pharmacutical history and did not even glance at the stack of medical records i brought with me;;;;
1668;i have been treated by some of the best in the country at john hopkins and walter reed and to be treated so unprofessionally in this office was an insult to the profession;;;;
1669;do not waste your time with dr;;;;
1670;brown!;;;;
1671;definitely a spot to check out when looking for a quality sandwich at a reasonable price;;;;
1672;the shop staff are very friendly and more than willing to accommodate any request;;;;
1673;do yourself a favor and get one of the steak sandwiches off of the menu;;;;
1674;they are amazing;;;;
1675;the ultra is my favorite;;;;
1676;also the cancun fries are awesome;;;;
1677;1 order is for sue big enough to serve 2 people maybe even 3!;;;;
1678;this is one of the peppis that takes credit cards as well;;;;
1679;not all do fyi;;;;
1680;i had the best vegan gardein chicken plate with broccolini;;;;
1681;i was blown away!!! the decor is cute! nicely dimly lit it was romantic and very chic;;;;
1682;i recommend coming if you're a vegan looking for a good dinner!;;;;
1683;i've dined here a few times with my family and we keep coming back despite a few misses;;;;
1684;i really want to be a fan of this place though;;;;
1685;the red salsa is good and hot while the green satisfies the less adventurous;;;;
1686;the guacamole (made to your specs at the table) is delicious and its pretty much all my 4 year old eats there;;;;
1687;i normally get the tacos either brisket or fish and they're really great though i'm not a fan of mango salsas in general;;;;
1688;last night we had the guac and a couple of wednesday special margaritas which were just right;;;;
1689;we thought the chips tasted a little stale though and the small bowl coupled with distracted waitstaff became empty quickly;;;;
1690;"my wife and i split the main dish which was a special ""baked brisket enchilada"" recommended by the waitress";;;;
1691;it was huge and definitely more than enough for too but we didn't care for it;;;;
1692;there didn't seem to be much beef in it;;;;
1693;it was mostly sauce and cheese;;;;
1694;it will be awhile before we go again and i think we'll stick to the tacos when we do;;;;
1695;in summary lots to like here but i'd say stick to the basics;;;;
1696;thank you so much tanner!  fantastic job;;;;
1697;super nice clean shop;;;;
1698;respectful professional;;;;
1699;just great;;;;
1700;thanks again;;;;
1701;well this was the first time trying this place since they just opened not long ago;;;;
1702;we wanted to try something different so we ordered the half sub and soup special;;;;
1703;i thought it was expensive if you ask me;;;;
1704;it was like $9;;;;
1705;so it was over $20 with 2 specials and a drink;;;;
1706;it didn't even fill you up for that kind of money!;;;;
1707;the soup comes in a small container and the sub is very small for being a half;;;;
1708;very disappointed in how much came on the sub;;;;
1709;they make them with their back to you and you can not see the items they put on and they don't even ask what you want on it;;;;
1710;they just proceed to make it the way they want;;;;
1711;i can honestly say you get so much more for your money at subway for much less and you can make the sub the way you want and you get very full and sometimes even have leftovers!;;;;
1712;the soup was hot and had a good flavor but such a small container and they fill just above half;;;;
1713;we didn't get much at all;;;;
1714;over all not our favorite sub place;;;;
1715;not happy;;;;
1716;not sure if we would go back here;;;;
1717;i love coming to pastel ! my favorite items are the black sesame crepe and the green tea crepe;;;;
1718;their waffles are good too but i personally like crepes more;;;;
1719;the ice cream and whipped cream is not too sweet which i like;;;;
1720;i recently tried their matcha batter crepe it wasn't bad but i prefer sticking to plain crepes with green tea or black sesame ice cream;;;;
1721;i think pastel is a great dessert spot after having dinner around the area;;;;
1722;the outdoor seating also makes it a perfect date spot in the summer;;;;
1723;"seeing ""chicago"" in the name of a taco shop gave me a little pause but the food and employees are both 5 stars";;;;
1724;the asada fries were awesome! the meat was well seasoned and had that perfect grilled crunch that i love;;;;
1725;you can choose nacho cheese or cheddar  i chose the cheddar and they put a good portion on;;;;
1726;it's topped with pico  sour cream   and a huge scoop of fresh guac;;;;
1727;lovely dish!;;;;
1728;i also had a pastor taco which is just like a traditional street taco you would find elsewhere;;;;
1729;the pastor was perfectly seasoned and had the same crunch from being grilled;;;;
1730;overall a great experience;;;;
1731;food was great and the staff was very friendly;;;;
1732;the owner came to the table to  ask how the food was and we talked for a few minutes;;;;
1733;he was genuinely interested in feedback and his passion for cooking and providing a great experience for his customers was very evident;;;;
1734;i recommend everyone stop in and give this place a try;;;;
1735;it is now on my list of regular lunch spots when i am on the n;;;;
1736;side;;;;
1737;what a cute place! i was visiting relatives in the area and we went here to grab coffee and breakfast;;;;
1738;the egg sandwich i got on a bagel was huge and tasty but it was pretty greasy;;;;
1739;the coffee is really good and the service is fast and friendly;;;;
1740;i recommend it!;;;;
1741;went to vegas again memorial day weekend but this time with my girlfriends so wanted them to try this place since loved it so much when i came with hubby;;;;
1742;this time tried the angry dog and just as amazingly deelish!!!;;;;
1743;friends got chili (homemade by buldogis) dog bulgogi bowl fries and again the euro fries with kimchee added and they loved it too!   my 2 friends who had the chili dog said the chili was very good! one of them is not even a hotdog fan and loved it;;;;
1744;if you are ever in vegas this is a must!!!;;;;
1745;good environment i ordered the famous meatloaf and it is large but a little bit salty;;;;
1746;the waitress is not that friendly but overall i had a great experience;;;;
1747;love this place!! delicious! i just wish it was closer to my house;;;;
1748;other than that i have no complaints;;;;
1749;the price point is reasonable and the menu selection is great;;;;
1750;couldn't ask for anything else!;;;;
1751;wonderful cookies but don't order delivery;;;;
1752;took almost 2 hours to deliver less than a mile;;;;
1753;and no refund;;;;
1754;food taste ok;;;;
1755;i like the pasta selection;;;;
1756;however there is no seafood choices at all;;;;
1757;if you are looking for seafood skip this place;;;;
1758;perfect grilled cheese was amazing and worth a repeat  visit;;;;
1759;chicken club lacked unique flavor and was average;;;;
1760;the blt was great with the bread making the sandwiches;;;;
1761;now for the sides;;;;
1762;tomato soup was delicious and a perfect complement to the grilled cheese;;;;
1763;shoe string fries were great nothing not to like about them and the green pea salad in peanut sauce was delicious;;;;
1764;we will definitely return for another try!;;;;
1765;good fresh and home cooked food;;;;
1766;loved breakfast especially biscuits and gravy small quaint place that does get busy;;;;
1767;decent pricing;;;;
1768;i went here today to upgrade to an iphone x;;;;
1769;they were awesome to work with;;;;
1770;they mirrored everything from my current phone to the new one;;;;
1771;that saved me so much time and aggravation if i had to do it;;;;
1772;they were very knowledgeable and friendly! highly recommend!;;;;
1773;i love this place and have been using it for three years now but i have to knock it down by one star because at times not often but it happens we'll get our normal stuff and it will be nothing like we're used to getting from them;;;;
1774;usually they are excellent however a couple of times now it has also been greasy tasteless and overcooked to a point where someone should really have noticed it on sight before it ever left the kitchen;;;;
1775;it's disappointing when that happens then wish you didn't bother;;;;
1776;as soon as i parked my car this rude elderly lady comes out saying these parking spaces are reserved;;;;
1777;i understand and can read that on your sign lady;;;;
1778;just because my other family members are dinning at hong kong garden for dim sum does not automatically mean that everyone is looking to eat there;;;;
1779;i was and had a craving for deli sandwiches in which i did ended up walking in to purchase 2 as planned (receipt still in hand);;;;
1780;don't go around assuming and start off with horrible service;;;;
1781;i ended up keeping my car parked there the whole afternoon taking a space just because that lady was rude;;;;
1782;***also would be nice to offer water for your customer that is waiting for his to-go order***;;;;
1783;we lived in mexico for several years so are always looking for authentic restaurants;;;;
1784;la taquizza does a good job;;;;
1785;their menu is diverse and includes many of our favourite dishes you don't typically find in canada;;;;
1786;the food is much better in house than as take out;;;;
1787;we have ordered many dishes off the menu and love anything carnitas and the fact that they have decent corn tortillas;;;;
1788;the huraches are great too;;;;
1789;i am a bit biased about the tacos al pastor since i lived in puebla but they are still ok;;;;
1790;can't miss the mandatory churros though;;;;
1791;they are amazing!;;;;
1792;this was a fun experience;;;;
1793;although sitting in the dark gets old pretty quickly;;;;
1794;i expected that the food was going to be amazing but it was just ok nothing fabulous;;;;
1795;for the price we paid i expected higher end cuisine;;;;
1796;they say you eat with your eyes and i now wonder if not having the visual of the food was part of the food tasting a bit bland for me!?! it's an interesting experience to eat in complete darkness wondering what the room looks like or what your food looks like;;;;
1797;at some point most people end up eating with their hands;;;;
1798;(you can't see where or what's on your plate);;;;
1799;i am so blown away by this sophisticated & beautiful hotel;;;;
1800;one of the best in las vegas;;;;
1801;the decor is breathe taking and this place always smell like a magical garden;;;;
1802;with so many top notch restaurants spa services shows and clubs to choose from;;;;
1803;it's vegas luxury! the last time i stayed here july 2011 it was such a big disappointment;;;;
1804;there was a total of 8 of us;;;;
1805;one of the bed broke and fell flat to the floor (no there were no foul play)! 6 out 8 of us left with some kind of bug bite that looks like a terrible case of eczema/rash! the mechanic curtain didn't work;;;;
1806;the main t;;;;
1807;didn't work;;;;
1808;actually disappointed is an understatement we were disgusted! how can this 5star resort & hotel failed us so miserably!!!!!?;;;;
1809;(please view pictures of rash);;;;
1810;the brussel sprout nachos are really as good as the other reviewers have mentioned! i've had them more then a few times and everyone always loves them be careful because they can easily fill you up! individual tacos and the burritos are great too;;;;
1811;i've also had a few of their salads and love them big a portion sizes;;;;
1812;great classic margarita as well love this place for groups esp on sunday when is all day happy hour!;;;;
1813;"really underwhelming flash brewed plastic spigot stored coffee coffee ""menu"" consists of different syrup and coffee concoctions rather than regional or single origin blends or even fresh roasted beans";;;;
1814;the red eye was okay certainly nothing special but drinkable;;;;
1815;once witnessed management screaming at kids over phone weird experience as a patron of a business;;;;
1816;gluten free options promised so we tried a turkey sandwich with avocado;;;;
1817;large portion--very delicious;;;;
1818;5 choices of iced tea blends(free refills) and coffee choices made for a perfect girls' afternoon;;;;
1819;lots of seating outside on the covered patio;;;;
1820;their parking fills quickly but plenty of options on street or at the municipal bldg;;;;
1821;we had a great lunch experience today at rubios;;;;
1822;it didn't start out that way but was quickly turned while we were checking out since we were using promotions;;;;
1823;we used the yelp check in offer for a free entree with the purchase of a drink which is an awesome way to try something new;;;;
1824;it was also ocean day insulated bag day which is really nice and will be used when grocery shopping this summer or transporting hot food to keep it warm;;;;
1825;we had a chimicurri steak burrito with chips as well as a cabo platter which is a burrito and taco;;;;
1826;the steak burrito was really good because of the chimicurri sauce which had a refreshing and light taste;;;;
1827;the shrimp burrito that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it;;;;
1828;the drinks they have are different and refreshing too i had a pomegranate lemonade by odowalla that uses real sugar instead of corn sryup;;;;
1829;i really recommend going to rubios for a lighter refreshing meal try the fish tacos and sign up for their club for emails on special offers;;;;
1830;so i've been coming here for years and have never had any issues until today;;;;
1831;i ordered what i've always ordered;;;;
1832;a bean burrito a taco and a drink;;;;
1833;it cost over $9 dollars!! the lady didn't tell me a price in the drive through which is annoying because they don't have a screen that tells you;;;;
1834;she asked if i wanted a bean and cheese burrito;;;;
1835;well obviously i said yes i want cheese in it;;;;
1836;the price on the menu said it was like $2;;;;
1837;there was no mention of cheese in my burrito costing more;;;;
1838;so i pull up to the window and she tells me it will be $9;;;;
1839;40 or whatever;;;;
1840;i said i'm sorry how much?? so i'm sitting there doing my own math and it still didn't add up;;;;
1841;09 for a drink $2 something for the taco and $2 something for the burrito;;;;
1842;even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much;;;;
1843;so i get the receipt and they charged me $4;;;;
1844;58 for a burrito!! there sign said $2 something;;;;
1845;i pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito;;;;
1846;i went up and asked why i was overcharged $4;;;;
1847;58 for a burrito;;;;
1848;he said because i got cheese in it;;;;
1849;i said your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? they always have and i've never been charged extra for it!! what place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? also for the first time their taco was bad;;;;
1850;i opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! usually it's nice and crispy/crunchy and this time was not;;;;
1851;i told them their signs are wrong;;;;
1852;also that it's ridiculous you charge that much for a burrito with cheese!! told them i will never be back!! i can get better food at taco bell and more food for the same price!! they don't false advertise there either! furious!  their food and prices have gone downhill fast! they lost mine and my family's business for good!!;;;;
1853;amazingly professional & compassionate staff;;;;
1854;we recently lost an animal member of the family and i was pleasantly surprised today with a follow up hand written sympathy card personalized and singed by the whole group;;;;
1855;thank you!;;;;
1856;came to this place based on yelp reviews and it did not disappoint;;;;
1857;got the chicken wings to start kao soi with chicken and an dish from the chefs special - steamed fish coconut curry;;;;
1858;chicken wings were good especially when hot the sauce gelatinized as it cooled;;;;
1859;kao soi was the best i've ever had an excellent portion ans the chicken was very tender;;;;
1860;the the fish coconut curry was good too wasn't much of a curry but was still very flavourful;;;;
1861;service was fast and people were so friendly and kind;;;;
1862;will definitely go back to try other menu items;;;;
1863;great food in a homely mexican setting;;;;
1864;the tomato soup was amazingly delicious and their chicken dishes are great;;;;
1865;close to the intersection of college & yonge this is one of the few non-fast food mexican restaurants in the village area;;;;
1866;if you're searching for a non-commercial dining experience with homemade dishes this is the place to come;;;;
1867;ikea;;;;
1868;an experience!;;;;
1869;i adore ikea! there is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room hence the showroom;;;;
1870;when you go to ikea it is simply a must to enjoy the top floor showroom area;;;;
1871;what i would have given to have had ikea in nc when i got my first apartment;;;;
1872;not only are the items affordable but seeing ikea's recommendations of how to decorate supply and organize a living space in 640 sq;;;;
1873;feet is a miracle! it totally works and somehow i find myself wanting to go live in a space that small!;;;;
1874;ikea can be intimidating in it's size and there being so much stuff but it is well worth it! i always go to ikea with a list of items that i am needing for the home and i always find it while also finding much more to leave with;;;;
1875;the greatest part of ikea is the price! there is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars/trucks/vans with your purchases;;;;
1876;to save the costs of ikea! this is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you the shopper!;;;;
1877;do yourself a favor plan a day! go and spend a few hours upstairs in the showroom have lunch in the cafe;;;;
1878;rest a bit then venture downstairs to get all the stuff your heart desires!;;;;
1879;ikea;;;;
1880;an experience!;;;;
1881;don't let the location or the look of the building fool you;;;;
1882;when i tell you this is the best place for authentic mexican eats! i cannot stop eating their taco gringos omg so yummy and everything is cooked to order right in front of you;;;;
1883;this is the only place that can compare to the hispanic food in california! you have to try it! definitely deserves more than 5 stars!!!!;;;;
1884;we love the all you can eat king crab legs on tuesdays;;;;
1885;service is good;;;;
1886;the food is good;;;;
1887;i enjoy the quick soup and salad for lunch;;;;
1888;seriously;;;;
1889;you will not be disappointed one bit!;;;;
1890;we were craving breakfast food and decided to check this place out;;;;
1891;we shared a skillet and a few breakfast sides each of which were cooked to perfection and super tasty;;;;
1892;the atmosphere here is cute clean and just what you want for enjoying your breakfast;;;;
1893;what really made our day being here was our awesome server tina;;;;
1894;she was so cool upbeat easy to talk with and was the most accommodating server you could ever hope to have;;;;
1895;we plan on returning for more good eats and to see tina again;;;;
1896;the one and only cashier working was so slow and  chatted with every customer while there is a long line;;;;
1897;i never seen anything like it! shooting the breeze while there is a long line of people who have other things to do is unacceptable;;;;
1898;with all the other negative reviews i hope they get there act together because sephora has much better service and hate to see another store close;;;;
1899;we had the curry it was really good but it was small portion for it's price;;;;
1900;the garlic chicken wasn't satisfying since it was dry no spices very plain and the chicken was kinda hard;;;;
1901;presentation was ok you gotta order the rice seperate;;;;
1902;the service was fine the servers were pretty casual with their guests;;;;
1903;would come back for curry but not for tandoori or kabob;;;;
1904;so based on food alone they would have 3 stars but thats just not the case;;;;
1905;arrived just after 5pm;;;;
1906;they had a private party going on but they looked to be well taken care of and winding down;;;;
1907;after placing our order we got our drinks and found a table;;;;
1908;went back to wait for our food and was told they will bring it out to us;;;;
1909;after 15 minutes and watching someone who ordered after us receive their food i went back up to the desk;;;;
1910;and watched as our food sat on the counter and for another 5 minutes before they finally brought it out;;;;
1911;and they didn't have our full order;;;;
1912;it took the food runner 3 separate trips;;;;
1913;heres a run down of our order;;;;
1914;pulled chicken;;;;
1915;not actually pulled but diced and dry;;;;
1916;turkey;;;;
1917;very good moist and tender;;;;
1918;pulled pork;;;;
1919;very good;;;;
1920;lot of flavor;;;;
1921;mac and cheese;;;;
1922;not the best but not the worst;;;;
1923;greenbeens;;;;
1924;good;;;;
1925;the only hot side we got;;;;
1926;banana bread pudding;;;;
1927;full of butter but not horrible;;;;
1928;overall food was 3 stars service was 1;;;;
1929;not the best part of town;;;;
1930;not particularly good (or particularly bad) service;;;;
1931;even the food isn't the best;;;;
1932;but the variety is awesome and unlike many places everything is pretty good;;;;
1933;some places have a good dish or two but the rest stinks;;;;
1934;not the china king;;;;
1935;it's all just solid food;;;;
1936;and not just chinese either - pizza and even macaroni and cheese can be found along with a huge salad bar dessert bar and real ice cream (not a soft serve machine);;;;
1937;from out of state and rolled up;;;;
1938;richard greeted us and we had great customer service;;;;
1939;thanks so much;;;;
1940;hank's definitely stays on my list of places that wow me;;;;
1941;great atmosphere from the bar area with live music to the great booth in the dining room with all the hustle and bustle of the staff creating that fine dining experience;;;;
1942;we felt very comfortable and well taken care of;;;;
1943;even had the manager share a bottle of wine with us! a memorable evening;;;;
1944;my husband and i used to order from here more than i'd like to admit (almost weekly);;;;
1945;the pizza is pretty mediocre but it's really cheap and convenient;;;;
1946;the cheesy bread subs chicken fingers and onion rings are pretty delicious;;;;
1947;we always order online (which i love) it's right around the corner delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes we're that lazy and really hate winter) and the delivery people are always super nice;;;;
1948;sadly they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going;;;;
1949;last time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery;;;;
1950;we ordered cheesy bread a philly sub and onion rings;;;;
1951;i asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings;;;;
1952;"i paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any ""inconvenience"" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem by the way)";;;;
1953;my husband showed up about 20 minutes after i ordered;;;;
1954;not only wasn't the food ready but apparently they hadn't even started it and were in no hurry;;;;
1955;he waited almost another hour (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it's about a one minute drive) to get our food;;;;
1956;they didn't comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything;;;;
1957;when we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind;;;;
1958;i'd waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that;;;;
1959;i hopped in the car because as i said it's literally around the corner and junk food just ain't the same without ranch for dippin;;;;
1960;i walked in;;;;
1961;"everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter) but i was clearly seen though nobody shouted a greeting or ""i'll be right with you";;;;
1962;""" finally a girl walked toward the front though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use";;;;
1963;i told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces could i just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order;;;;
1964;now that may have been an excessive amount but i had low blood sugar brain;;;;
1965;and at this point i figured they'd throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they'd screwed up!);;;;
1966;instead she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order;;;;
1967;why? i have no idea;;;;
1968;but she said she was new so i said fine;;;;
1969;she went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man who i assume is the owner most certainly the boss;;;;
1970;expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology or at least a how can i help you i was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who i was and what i ordered;;;;
1971;he also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason;;;;
1972;it was like they all had amnesia! you don't remember the tall skinny dude who just left after waiting for his order for an hour?! he told me what i ordered like i was on crack and what was the problem;;;;
1973;i said yes i know what i ordered but i requested ranch and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it;;;;
1974;again he rudely asked me how many i wanted incredulous i was asking;;;;
1975;it was like the freakin inquisition;;;;
1976;do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn't get ranch with their orders?? he started taking containers out of the fridge;;;;
1977;"i was so upset by this point that i don't even know what he said that prompted me say ""wow you are really something else";;;;
1978;""" there were four containers of ranch on the counter which i snatched while i could and turned around to walk out at which point he yelled after me how they're 75 cents a piece";;;;
1979;i may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me;;;;
1980;i honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service i have ever received;;;;
1981;it certainly tops the list as worst interaction/confrontation with a stranger;;;;
1982;i can't believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that let alone a proprietor to a customer;;;;
1983;i worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand;;;;
1984;offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten;;;;
1985;i realize no one cares or will ever read this;;;;
1986;my husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it but i was just so incredulous about the entire thing;;;;
1987;it was cathartic;;;;
1988;i feel better;;;;
1989;though that will be of little comfort next time i want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere;;;;
1990;just found out about this secret treasure!  love this studio and the staff!!!! i haven't practiced yoga in a studio for a while but this place is very welcoming to yogi's of all levels! i love power flow with shannon- she's got a great energy and inspires me to challenge myself! love love love this studio! if you are going for the first time park off glenway by the bank- its easier to find!;;;;
1991;amazing service great vibe and fair prices;;;;
1992;their asian/hawaiian fusion was perfect;;;;
1993;we'll be back!;;;;
1994;real friends show up with bosa donuts when things are awry;;;;
1995;their boba tea is yummy but needs more ball choices;;;;
1996;dined here a couple of weeks ago on a saturday night -- actually sat at the bar with my three fellow diners and had an absolutely amazing evening -- food wine service all made for a perfect experience;;;;
1997;tried almost all the appetizers and 'small plates' and they were exceptional;;;;
1998;standouts were;;;;
1999;almond spread harcha bread quinoa salad beef kefta;;;;
2000;shared a fish tagine for 4 and it was also excellent!;;;;
2001;highly recommend this place - i know we'll be back!;;;;
2002;i love this place;;;;
2003;i come here whenever i'm in town for business;;;;
2004;the taco tuesday deals are unbelievably amazing;;;;
2005;the tacos are only two dollars each but they could be charging much more for the quality that they are;;;;
2006;they also have a good ipa on tap that is only five dollars a pint;;;;
2007;all of the staff is incredibly nice and they have great music here too;;;;
2008;i also love the fact that there's tons of monitors everywhere so you can see games from every angle of the venue;;;;
2009;they also have a great outdoor seating area that is right on the sidewalk and located on a busy downtown corner which suits all the people watchers well;;;;
2010;great food and greatcustomer service;;;;
2011;they messed up my order and when they realized they apologized and returned our money;;;;
2012;love this place;;;;
2013;great atmosphere - sports bar but with just the right amount of class;;;;
2014;great house beers friendly serving staff amazing drunk food;;;;
2015;a fun place to go with friends ir family + an adventuruous take on the traditional bar menu;;;;
2016;around $45 for a dinner on a friday night;;;;
2017;snow and kind crab caviar steak tartare all types of meat and cuts sushi soups asian cuisine pastas and pizzas;;;;
2018;literally all you can think about;;;;
2019;almost everything we tried was really good;;;;
2020;their dessert section and flavors are one of the best !;;;;
2021;recommended for sure;;;;
2022;we found out about this gem from the man's co-worker who used to live in the same apt;;;;
2023;complex we live in now;;;;
2024;it's about a mile away from our apt;;;;
2025;and we finally gave it a try a while back;;;;
2026;it is delicious! the chips are mini tortillas that you break off and have with salsa;;;;
2027;very yum;;;;
2028;the food is delicious! i don't remember what i had the last time we went here but i managed to finish more than half of it and had some to take home (tastes better later imo);;;;
2029;the portions are generous and filling;;;;
2030;the wait staff is always nice and attentive;;;;
2031;i remember the first time we visited it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait too long for a table;;;;
2032;if we're in the mood for mexican food and don't want a fast food experience we definitely choose this place;;;;
2033;went in on a friday since i was strolling around the venetian and came across this place! the wait wasn't too bad around 1pm (probably 25 minutes max);;;;
2034;this place serves a variety of latin american cuisines including tapas tacos and burgers! it's standard pricing for vegas;;;;
2035;i ordered the brisket tacos and i didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary;;;;
2036;service was okay but i thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating;;;;
2037;however the portions are on the smaller side so it's perfect to have lunch there if you don't want lug any leftovers around!;;;;
2038;paid for a view of the strip;;;;
2039;very disappointed;;;;
2040;viewed the pool saw through ti facade trump tower;;;;
2041;not worth the extra price;;;;
2042;restaurant choices were great food was good casino was fun;;;;
2043;rooms are okay;;;;
2044;would think twice before staying again;;;;
2045;customer was excellant;;;;
2046;the staff is out;;;;
2047;standing;;;;
2048;if you like 80's hair band music this is the place to be;;;;
2049;the audience really gets into it as well;;;;
2050;from the flashlight lighter to the hair extensions you will feel like you are entering a time machine to the past;;;;
2051;the show is very high energy and it amazes me how the cast can perform at that level on a daily basis especially that dancers;;;;
2052;the story is somewhat contrived and they try to fit too much into the show in order to justify certain song choices but most of the songs are excellently performed;;;;
2053;it is worth a visit for the nostalgia alone;;;;
2054;i'm a fan of bmw;;;;
2055;my x3 lasted me 10 years and although there were a few hiccups i can still say that car was pretty darn reliable and i got my money's worth;;;;
2056;but sometimes you just have to let go and find a replacement;;;;
2057;i did my research and considered getting a mini fiat or a lexus;;;;
2058;my loyalty is with bmw;;;;
2059;i locked in on a particular car and off to the dealer i went;;;;
2060;we were walking around the lot looking at other models and colors when a car salesman saw us and helped me get my car;;;;
2061;my sister kept throwing her ideas and opinions as to what car i should get;;;;
2062;i told david (sales advisor) what features i need and we ended up with the first car i was looking at;;;;
2063;then the dreaded test driving the car;;;;
2064;i'm not a big fan of driving a car that isn't mine;;;;
2065;or driving period! i think convincing me to test drive took the most time and david told me to just drive around the lot but that was a trick! there was a part of the lot that's blocked off by a semi and the only way around it is to get on the road;;;;
2066;my sister was a backseat driver as if i needed to be more anxious but david kept me calm;;;;
2067;he's so funny;;;;
2068;we made it back to the dealership in one piece;;;;
2069;i signed my papers and wrote my check but it was gym time so we told david we'd come back for the car after the gym since they still had to detail it anyway;;;;
2070;it was the most entertaining car-buying experience ever;;;;
2071;we were all laughing and chatting about cars the gym nutrition hello kitty yoda etc;;;;
2072;"david explained and showed me what my car can do and at the end he said ""i wish all my clients are as fun as you";;;;
2073;i get follow-up phone calls and e-mails and if i have any questions about my car david responds quickly;;;;
2074;if you ever need/want a car contact david politzer - he is fantastic and he has a nice profile picture on his business card too;;;;
2075;this place rules! best tacos in town and not too pricy! always clean and has an awesome patio;;;;
2076;staff is friendly very welcoming;;;;
2077;will def be back!;;;;
2078;without a doubt  my favorite indian restaurant to date;;;;
2079;there is a lot of variety but my favorite dish is the chicken korma;;;;
2080;the butter chicken is also fantastic;;;;
2081;it is deliciously sweet and kid-friendly because it is not too spicy;;;;
2082;for those of you who like to feel the burn they have plenty of options to choose from as well;;;;
2083;i recommend the thali for people who are just starting to explore their asian culinary senses;;;;
2084;also if you are a naan connoisseur you need add palais d'ajit to your list;;;;
2085;don't expect any fancy surroundings;;;;
2086;it looks like a hole in the wall but you'll be convinced to enter the door when you get a whiff of the food (which can be detected from a block away);;;;
2087;the staff are very friendly although sometimes the service is slow;;;;
2088;if you don't like to wait call ahead and take it home!;;;;
2089;simply the best place to call home;;;;
2090;all the amenities cool vibe great pool scene 24 hour concierge service same day laundry dedicated parking secure entry;;;;
2091;hoa reasonable;;;;
2092;what's not to like in condo living?;;;;
2093;overall;;;;
2094;the food isn't good (i explain below) but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money);;;;
2095;let me explain;;;;
2096;"there are not many ""old"" restaurants in this town";;;;
2097;we don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time;;;;
2098;i think we should;;;;
2099;even when the food isn't show stopping;;;;
2100;why? this place has tremendous character and charm;;;;
2101;"there's an ""old western vegas"" feel to bob taylor's";;;;
2102;established in 1955 it's the oldest restaurant in las vegas;;;;
2103;its a throwback to a rugged carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades;;;;
2104;and still exists;;;;
2105;i did appreciate the slice of vegas kitch that bob taylor's offers;;;;
2106;food issues;;;;
2107;so with all that charm how could this place go wrong? this place could be great;;;;
2108;it really should be great;;;;
2109;but they are not putting enough care into the food;;;;
2110;i ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare;;;;
2111;i was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made i'd be in the medium range;;;;
2112;my instincts were correct;;;;
2113;but the steak was closer to well done;;;;
2114;in total three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked;;;;
2115;in a steakhouse;;;;
2116;with a man tasked with grilling the steaks;;;;
2117;sigh;;;;
2118;the fourth steak smoked prime rib was cooked properly;;;;
2119;but the prime rib is cooked ahead if time right? how was i prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? how did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care?;;;;
2120;i'll tell you;;;;
2121;when we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it;;;;
2122;but the chef was not watching the meat;;;;
2123;he wasn't even in front of the grill;;;;
2124;he was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors;;;;
2125;and there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived;;;;
2126;so i figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention;;;;
2127;i ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak;;;;
2128;both were fine;;;;
2129;but there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg is there? people rave about the garlic bread and i think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal;;;;
2130;it was just ok;;;;
2131;the most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough butter and three types of cheese;;;;
2132;a few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good;;;;
2133;after tasting it i was grateful to have passed on this wet mush;;;;
2134;service;;;;
2135;our waitress was very attentive and responsive;;;;
2136;she was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks;;;;
2137;i won't be back but i'm glad to have visited this historic spot;;;;
2138;service;;;;
2139;4 stars;;;;
2140;kitch;;;;
2141;4 stars;;;;
2142;food;;;;
2143;1 star;;;;
2144;azzip pizza is literally so good;;;;
2145;"i have been there so many times and each time i get a ""big zip"" for $8";;;;
2146;the place is amazing and the pizza cooks in about 2 minutes;;;;
2147;it is the build your own concept and i have never had a bad experience there;;;;
2148;also i go there about 4 times a week;;;;
2149;don't worry i hit the gym sometimes;;;;
2150;love this place;;;;
2151;we go all the time;;;;
2152;wings are the best cocktails are good and well priced;;;;
2153;don't confuse with the terrible place with a similar name on thurnderbird and 43 avenue;;;;
2154;when i compare over easy with other places maybe i don't find it my ultimate sunday morning family breakfast place but i'd definitely drop by with my pals for some home-style fries once in a while;;;;
2155;everything is what you'd expect from a $10-$15 breakfast and that's why i gave it 4-stars;;;;
2156;the waitresses are really nice and friendly which is the kick start of a good morning;;;;
2157;"go with ""the big breakfast"" for ~$12 if you're hungry and i'm telling you you'd be pretty full by the end of it you wouldn't want lunch!";;;;
2158;just took the 6;;;;
2159;30am class - my muscles have been so sore from crossfit and i needed a good stretching;;;;
2160;i really need more yoga in my life! the class was fantastic! a nice 60 minute class heated and the music was lovely;;;;
2161;the yoga instructor's voice was soothing - which i think is soo important;;;;
2162;what a great class;;;;
2163;i feel refreshed! a great studio as well - nice and roomie;;;;
2164;looking forward to my next class!;;;;
2165;food is prepared fresh and flavored are great;;;;
2166;eaten three lunches and all were great;;;;
2167;service is a combined effort so they on top of any needs;;;;
2168;i ate at new india bazaar for dinner;;;;
2169;i took it to go;;;;
2170;i ordered samosa pani puri chaat and gobi;;;;
2171;the samosas were very good and very big! the main dish gobi was really great;;;;
2172;as a vegetarian it seemed like i was eating chicken but it was cauliflower dumplings;;;;
2173;the gobi had a comfort food appeal;;;;
2174;the pani puri chaat was weird;;;;
2175;i've never had it before so i don't have a comparison;;;;
2176;the description sounded yummy but it just wasn't;;;;
2177;the total cost was about $14;;;;
2178;i would recommend this restaurant;;;;
2179;i noticed that they have a pastry case with desserts;;;;
2180;i plan to come back to shop;;;;
2181;they  have the best prices that i've seen on neem toothpastes;;;;
2182;awesome food and service! really wish we had one in oahu! our servers were on it! thank you for working it out and fitting in our party of 9!;;;;
2183;i went here yesterday and i got the best service i ever got at a restaurant;;;;
2184;the waiter helped me on the grill constantly checked on me to see if everything was ok the food was great and so was the service and everything was a++++ pricing was great as well it came out to around $18;;;;
2185;i am going back to vegas for my birthday next month i will try there sushis;;;;
2186;the four stars = to  how expensive this place is;;;;
2187;i only saw two dollar signs for this place but it should be four dollar signs;;;;
2188;i don't remember what i ordered but it all came to $75;;;;
2189;( 2 ) bacon egg sandwiches;;;;
2190;( 2 ) other breakfast sandwiches;;;;
2191;( 2 ) breakfast desserts;;;;
2192;( 2 ) juices or water;;;;
2193;i'm pretty sure this was all i ordered;;;;
2194;it tasted good because at 2;;;;
2195;30am we were all hungry;;;;
2196;i ordered to go since the place was packed from all the clubbers and hotel guests that was here;;;;
2197;i remember that i didn't have to wait very long after placing my order;;;;
2198;i remember that we all scarfed it down in matter of a minute;;;;
2199;i vaguely remember crawling into bed soon after;;;;
2200;hi went to anthonys last thurs;;;;
2201;night with a party of seven;;;;
2202;we were celebrating an anniversary  we all dressed up to the nines ! ! wanted to have a fun nite out !;;;;
2203;the food is good very high end;;;;
2204;2 of us ordered the prime rib 2 others ordered filet 3 others steak plus apps of sashimi tator tots mashed potatoes;;;;
2205;spinach lobster bisques for all they do charge extra for everything;;;;
2206;so watch out,;;;;
2207;we sat outside it is a nice view;;;;
2208;now the bad part;;;;
2209;our waiter fabio;;;;
2210;i don't like to be disrespectful to our food servers here in vegas cuz they do work hard but fabio is;;;;
2211;very rude rushed us during our ordering did not want to explain the specials after my uncle asked a question he said he did not know did not bring our drinks until after our dinner was served by someone else he was very rude when we asked for another martini and never brought it;;;;
2212;he also did not bring water until we asked four times cuz we passed on the bubbles water he also tried to take out plates before we were done ! the place was empty three times he wanted to take my plate with food on it;;;;
2213;jeeeez;;;;
2214;anthonys please he needs more training on how to treat customers;;;;
2215;a tale of two locations (aka;;;;
2216;avoid 7700 s autoplex go to 616 w baseline);;;;
2217;first the good;;;;
2218;616 w baseline;;;;
2219;i have been a loyal repeat customer of cobblestone auto spa ever since i encountered jared one of the managers at the 616 w baseline;;;;
2220;the first time i went there i had my car detailed for $150 after discounts;;;;
2221;the detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed;;;;
2222;as a result there appeared to be some minor scratching;;;;
2223;jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed;;;;
2224;i was very impressed with him as i watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine;;;;
2225;i was impressed enough that i told the man to his face that i was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work;;;;
2226;i am not good with names or dates but i remember this man's name because he does his job with pride;;;;
2227;after jared i became a fastpass customer and still remain one;;;;
2228;cobblestone pay close attention! this is the kind of employee you need more of!;;;;
2229;now the bad;;;;
2230;7700 s autoplex;;;;
2231;i first went to this location because i needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes;;;;
2232;i got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway;;;;
2233;i also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location;;;;
2234;i let that all slide as just being an off day;;;;
2235;i then went a second time for a wash also below standard;;;;
2236;i also let that slide;;;;
2237;i then went to get a wash yesterday;;;;
2238;not only was the wash worse than ever but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before i came! to begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all;;;;
2239;there was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned;;;;
2240;the only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent;;;;
2241;there were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats;;;;
2242;when i pointed out the mess on the dash initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off;;;;
2243;i was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail;;;;
2244;the manager who i do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report;;;;
2245;i remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because i knew they caused the problem;;;;
2246;at this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem;;;;
2247;they were disrespectful and discourteous;;;;
2248;finally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash;;;;
2249;they asked me to come back the next day;;;;
2250;obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort;;;;
2251;i went home frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day;;;;
2252;the next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care and no effort to clean anything i discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat;;;;
2253;keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed but tossed on the back seat;;;;
2254;i knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size;;;;
2255;also these were obviously clean panties so i gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry;;;;
2256;i suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact i was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality tv;;;;
2257;as a result i was livid;;;;
2258;i had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury;;;;
2259;i went to the 7700 location immediately and complained;;;;
2260;they clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee;;;;
2261;they reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it;;;;
2262;at this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when i brought the car in;;;;
2263;i was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location;;;;
2264;jared to the rescue;;;;
2265;i took the car directly to the 616 location and saw jared busily working with his staff;;;;
2266;i pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff;;;;
2267;after being checked in i called out to jared and explained the situation to him;;;;
2268;he dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory;;;;
2269;this was not his problem his staff did not cause it but he fixed it;;;;
2270;lesson;;;;
2271;never go to the 7700 location! always go to the 616 location!;;;;
2272;cobblestone bad managers make for a bad staff;;;;
2273;great managers make for a great staff;;;;
2274;i have visited this place several times;;;;
2275;they have great happy hour prices and their regular menu prices are very reasonable too;;;;
2276;their entrees are big enough to share my favorite is their fish tacos;;;;
2277;they tend to get pretty busy on friday nights so there is sometimes a bit of a wait;;;;
2278;overall thumbs up!;;;;
2279;the location was excellent and the restaurant was beautiful;;;;
2280;the food was awful and our server was very rude and impolite;;;;
2281;we were a group of 6 people and whatever we ordered was worse than another one!;;;;
2282;even my little daughter who loves french fries couldn't eat them because they weren't fresh and she thought that they were artificial!!!;;;;
2283;my favorite burger joint! simple yet delicious! service is always great with cheerful greetings and happy smiles;;;;
2284;good place always willing to stop by n shop;;;;
2285;hate that they dnt have what they are kniwn for but some of the buttenders help out !;;;;
2286;juan's is always busy because it's always good;;;;
2287;it's great food but the excellent friendly service is what keeps people coming back;;;;
2288;i've been here dozens of times;;;;
2289;date nights with family with kids girls nights;;;;
2290;always wonderful;;;;
2291;try the shrimp ceviche!;;;;
2292;came here while in town for a country concert;;;;
2293;what better way to start our day;;;;
2294;everything was great;;;;
2295;the service was amazing from the time we walked in the door;;;;
2296;we were sat at a table and to our surprise there is a beer and whiskey tap at the table;;;;
2297;you pay by the ounce and there is a screen to show you what you've drank;;;;
2298;the food we had was great;;;;
2299;the whiskey burger was my favorite;;;;
2300;for you country fans this is a must when in scottsdale!;;;;
2301;fabulous;;;;
2302;a friend took me here last night;;;;
2303;wonderful food we had panang curry duck fried rice and chilean sea bass;;;;
2304;what a wonderful combination of flavors;;;;
2305;i was very skeptical about this spot;;;;
2306;first it's almost impossible to find good authentic legit spots on the las vegas strip for exotic cuisines- hispanic asian middle eastern etc;;;;
2307;if you want one go off the strip;;;;
2308;"second a place that proudly serves ""middle eastern"" and also ""greek"" food usually misses those authentic flavors";;;;
2309;for example serving jewish latkes israeli/middle eastern humus and greek moussaka is usually just too much for a fusion;;;;
2310;and yet the food was tasty! even tough it wasn't 100% loyal to the original flavors or shapes of the middle east the food was yummy! and i do have to give them a round of applause for their hummus;;;;
2311;simply really good!;;;;
2312;the lamb shawarma was also good;;;;
2313;and branzino fish with labaneh was on point;;;;
2314;even though our hostess did a terrible job our server was lovely;;;;
2315;so bottom line;;;;
2316;worth visiting;;;;
2317;a solid 4 stars spot;;;;
2318;trust me;;;;
2319;i know food;;;;
2320;worse than before;;;;
2321;overpriced and horrible service;;;;
2322;"when a group says ""we're really thirsty";;;;
2323;"could you please bring water while we look at the menu?"" you'd better frickin' bring it!";;;;
2324;our waiter was pushy rude and s;;;;
2325;when we said that we weren't interested in hearing the specials he read them anyway;;;;
2326;he constantly tried to upsell us;;;;
2327;"every order placed was followed by a pause and ""well you know what would be really good";;;;
2328;"?"" followed by a big description of a more expensive item or an add-on";;;;
2329;the desperately needed water took almost twenty minutes to get to our table;;;;
2330;the table next to us who was seated at least five minutes after us received their water drinks and first course before we even got our water;;;;
2331;do i sound like i'm obsessing about water? in the desert dehydration is no joke and it's indicative of the quality (bad - very very bad) of service that we received;;;;
2332;the sushi was good but not great;;;;
2333;the main courses were simple but extremely expensive;;;;
2334;all sides were extra;;;;
2335;we spent about $250 for three people on very basic food and a glass of wine each;;;;
2336;never again;;;;
2337;never never never;;;;
2338;hands down this is the best pizza place in mentor! their pizza is so delicious that the smell alone is enough to make you drool! the cheesy bread is soft and cheesy and just goodness;;;;
2339;the pizza is good for leftovers and the next day;;;;
2340;the service and staff is very friendly;;;;
2341;5 stars for sure!;;;;
2342;i went with the ziti;;;;
2343;just as i remembered the sauce was awful;;;;
2344;the pasta was in a pool of water and the sauce had zero flavor;;;;
2345;i just feel like a sauce can make or break the meal and it was tasteless-- no garlic onion wine basil;;;;
2346;nothing;;;;
2347;the portion was also quite small for the price;;;;
2348;it was clearly boxed pasta and not homemade so why so stingy? i'm surprised there are such high reviews on here actually as my experience and my family's experience wasn't great;;;;
2349;i guess it's a decent place for families but i would definitely go to a different italian restaurant if you're looking for good food;;;;
2350;we usually go to lindo michoacã¡n when we want mexican at a sit down restaurant but i felt like we were just there and talked my husband into trying juan's;;;;
2351;ok we're hooked! service was great;;;;
2352;we got the fajitas for 2 with steak and chicken add cheese;;;;
2353;so good lots of flavor;;;;
2354;loved the fideo soup and chips with the onions and peppers the salsa and bean dip were good although not my favorite;;;;
2355;my only other gripe is smelling of fajita when we left i smelled like i had worked the grill my clothes were saturated with the smell and my skin felt greasy;;;;
2356;i had noticed the smell and cloud of smoke in the restaurant when we sat down;;;;
2357;i'll just be sure not to have anything special planned after we eat here;;;;
2358;prices were on par with other mexican restaurants and you get more than enough to eat;;;;
2359;we will definitely be back and we'll be packing the febreeze!;;;;
2360;do your research people this place is completely unprofessional;;;;
2361;i went in for a juvederm procedure in my lips and i was very disappointed by the way i looked right after the procedure and even several weeks after;;;;
2362;my lips were extremely painful swollen bruised and disproportioned;;;;
2363;this place is not a good place to go to for lip augmentation be aware;;;;
2364;choose a good md;;;;
2365;service was prompt and good;;;;
2366;i ordered the roti canai which was excellent and also filling;;;;
2367;the chicken curry for the roti wasn't thick i think that's a good combination as a dip;;;;
2368;i also ordered the lamb curry (i forgot the exact name;;;;
2369;rendang?) the flavor was good but i didn't like the taste of the meat the chicken or beef version is probably better;;;;
2370;the lamb meat i feel tastes like lamb sweat;;;;
2371;at least that's what i imagined it to be;;;;
2372;i only gave it 4 stars because i wasn't satisfied with the lamb meat and some of the items there were a bit pricey;;;;
2373;other than that it's excellent and i like their beverages that they have a grass jelly drink and malaysian iced tea;;;;
2374;will definitely come back again next time;;;;
2375;it's extremely annoying that the venetian chooses to broadcast fox news at their vip lounges against their customers' will and employees' will;;;;
2376;i would consider this harassment since neither have a choice to change the channel;;;;
2377;i've tried;;;;
2378;i have complained to the employees who state they are not able to change the channel;;;;
2379;trust me the venetian customers and their employees do not want to be forced to watch fox news;;;;
2380;please change to a neutral channel or cnn which provides more transparent news;;;;
2381;my boyfriend and i went here for dinner evening and all i can say is it was awesome;;;;
2382;be prepared the drinks are powerful here and we made the mistake of getting tequila shots on the side;;;;
2383;but the frozen margarita house drinks did not need it;;;;
2384;needless to say we took our time drinking and eating so we could travel home safely;;;;
2385;fantastic time;;;;
2386;we will definitely visit this restaurant again;;;;
2387;by the way;;;;
2388;i had the chicken shrimp and spinach entree and john had the mahi-mahi tacos;;;;
2389;so good!;;;;
2390;i remember going to this salon a few years ago and i loved how fast thier service was(under 45 min);;;;
2391;i'm glad that that hasn't changed;;;;
2392;i did a refill on my seaweed bio gel nails with an air brushed french manicure because i saw it here on yelp and i didn't even know that was an option;;;;
2393;my nail tech was nice she understood what i wanted and was very fast( without sacrificing quality);;;;
2394;sadly my only complain is that this place is located in markham which is out of my way;;;;
2395;it would be cool if they opened up another location in the north york or downtown area;;;;
2396;i'm a regular at chipotle in california this is my first visit to this chipotle on s;;;;
2397;las vegas strip;;;;
2398;this is pretty new place i think i took a veggie bowl in which the rice was undone and the fajitas were all burnt the quantity offered was less than usual;;;;
2399;i'm very unhappy with this place;;;;
2400;what an incredible experience this was;;;;
2401;there is nothing particular special about the neighborhood atmosphere but don't let that deter you;;;;
2402;we were seated on the outside patio which was lovely on a warm summer evening;;;;
2403;the service was exceptional as the staff was incredibly kind and attentive but it was the food that really made this experience;;;;
2404;from the crispy shrimp appetizer and beef tartar to the octopus special and veal flank steak the food was simply amazing;;;;
2405;unfortunately we're from the san francisco area so may not be back any time soon but if this were in our home town neighborhood we would come back weekly!;;;;
2406;i have taken my family to this place before;;;;
2407;we were quite happy with the service and food;;;;
2408;recently i bought a groupon for this restaurant;;;;
2409;we were not happy at all with the service and food;;;;
2410;first they ask if we were using groupon and they marked it in a separate sheet;;;;
2411;we had no service at all;;;;
2412;the restaurant was not full and we saw other tables had their food while they order after us;;;;
2413;we waited for almost 30 minutes only two dishes came;;;;
2414;we spoke to the manager and the waiter for the rest of the orders;;;;
2415;they said to check on our orders;;;;
2416;my kids got hungry and only ate fried rice that came;;;;
2417;finally when the order dish came and it was very salty;;;;
2418;we would definitely not recommend this place if you plan to buy groupon;;;;
2419;we felt we were second class;;;;
2420;we would prefer to go elsewhere where we get excellent service and much better vegetarian food and we don't mind paying the little extra,such as graceful vegetarian by market village;;;;
2421;i had the large cheese pizza;;;;
2422;while i sat and waited i observed the following;;;;
2423;phones have the most germs on them of almost anything;;;;
2424;the young man grating the cheese played with his smartphone typing out a few messages;;;;
2425;replaced it to his pocket and continued handling the cheese without washing his hands or using any plastic gloves;;;;
2426;the young lady was cleaning dirty tables with a rag  and spray;;;;
2427;not a problem except when she was done she put the spray bottle up and didn't bother washing her hands either and went immediately to handling food items in the back;;;;
2428;pizza was fine but barely had enough cheese on it to cover it;;;;
2429;fair for the price;;;;
2430;on a previous visit i had the gyro sandwich;;;;
2431;i found it to be very wet and gooey not much flavor at all to the meat;;;;
2432;my last visit;;;;
2433;i will say the pizza prices are fair for what they are offering;;;;
2434;my problem is the lack of being sanitary;;;;
2435;these guys really are great easy to work with and provide a valuable service;;;;
2436;i worked with sammy to coordinate a night out with 10 girls for a bachelorette party in vegas;;;;
2437;we decided to go to tryst;;;;
2438;sammy was very patient in taking multiple phone calls and answering all my questions even throwing in a couple of extra perks at my request;;;;
2439;the pre-pay service is great--the company takes the total cost of the evening and divides it per person creating a link online where each girl can go and pay ahead of time;;;;
2440;we didn't have to deal with a large bill or everyone's credit cards at the end of the night;;;;
2441;it was so easy;;;;
2442;someone from the company was in constant contact with me leading up to our night out;;;;
2443;sammy knowing how large of a group we had and how important a good table was to us called me the night of to let me know they'd had a different better table open up and that he was giving it to us at no extra charge;;;;
2444;craig was our host for the evening;;;;
2445;he contacted me promptly to provide detailed instructions on where to meet him and when;;;;
2446;craig was waiting to greet us and as promised walked us right into the club and to our table which had our bottles mixers and waitresses waiting;;;;
2447;craig stopped back a couple of times before leaving to make sure we were settled and having a good time;;;;
2448;i contacted sammy a couple more times throughout the weekend for various things and he was more than helpful even though we weren't using them for additional reservations or nights out;;;;
2449;planning ahead is the way to go when it comes to vegas and while i don't think you have to use an outside vip company to plan i don't really see a disadvantage to doing so;;;;
2450;i would definitely call red carpet vip again;;;;
2451;the worst;;;;
2452;got there 45 minutes after the store was supposed to be open and they weren't ready;;;;
2453;ordered a sandwich and the oven hadn't been turned on;;;;
2454;i asked how long and the employee said a few minutes;;;;
2455;8 minutes later oven still not preheated and i let her know i had to go;;;;
2456;she then pulls the sandwich out of the oven;;;;
2457;cleary the sandwich would not have been prepared correctly;;;;
2458;i did not take sandwich and had to leave to get to an appointment;;;;
2459;my  quick stop for a coffee and breakfast to go was over 15 minutes;;;;
2460;when i sent in a complaint to the head office the slow response was they couldn't give me a credit but would send over coupons for a couple of beverages;;;;
2461;that is ridiculous;;;;
2462;i wanted a refund on the sandwich i never took;;;;
2463;i pass by this second cup 5 days a week;;;;
2464;i'm going to keep on driving and stick with starbucks;;;;
2465;you should also steer clear;;;;
2466;best example of the worst service;;;;
2467;i went to dr;;;;
2468;goth for a couple procedures including wisdom teeth and to have a suspicious oral growth removed;;;;
2469;only one word - fantastic! his staff is excellent and his art in dentistry and patient care unsurpassed;;;;
2470;cut and dried - dr;;;;
2471;goth was outstanding;;;;
2472;he is the man to see in the pittsburgh area;;;;
2473;2-3 years ago i found lifescape medical associates randomly and started going there since then;;;;
2474;paying an annual fee i'm expecting receiving services which are at least at the average level;;;;
2475;however lifescape disappointed me again and again over the years;;;;
2476;i have to give credit to their office environment though it's always quiet and clean and the receptionists are always friendly;;;;
2477;there're a few reasons i don't like it there;;;;
2478;i feel like the doctor is always suggesting me with some medicine/samples/tests and some of them are not necessary at all;;;;
2479;for example the doctor suggested me with a special blood test twice saying that the test would be very beneficial for me and my insurance should cover the cost;;;;
2480;i believed her and had my blood drawn at their lab;;;;
2481;later i got a bill for almost $2000 (i know lifescape always charges high prices luckily i have a good health insurance so i don't really care but still $2000 for a blood test is too much! ) i called my insurance company my insurance company said the test was actually done in a out-of-state lab so they will only pay for a small portion;;;;
2482;i immediately called lifescape and left a message no one replied;;;;
2483;a few days later i decided to go to their office in person they lied to me that the blood test would just cost whatever my insurance company is willing to pay and i would not be charged for extra;;;;
2484;i believed them and left;;;;
2485;but a few weeks later i received another bill;;;;
2486;i called them a few more times explaining the issue;;;;
2487;they told me that a specialist would call me back but nobody ever did;;;;
2488;i'm really disappointed;;;;
2489;how can people trust them if they do business like that!!! what's worse up to this day they still haven't informed me anything about the bill nor the blood test result itself;;;;
2490;the waiting time in the clinic is too long;;;;
2491;i always have to wait there for 30-50 minutes passed the appointment time;;;;
2492;i know the doctor is busy but the patient's time is precious too;;;;
2493;i don't like taking my work hours off and just wasting it on waiting for the doctor;;;;
2494;and when i finally get to meet with the doctor i can tell that she is not patient enough;;;;
2495;she seems in a hurry i know she wants to finish up our conversation asap and move on to the next patient;;;;
2496;they don't have xray machines;;;;
2497;if you are need to get some xray or ct scan done i suggest you going somewhere else even some small clinics have xray machines;;;;
2498;i normally only write positive reviews online but this time i want to let people know about what's really going on there;;;;
2499;i would not go there any more and i do not recommend lifescape to anybody;;;;
2500;i love the west side market but i can't stand the crowds the parking and the general gentrified douchery that seems to accompany the entire process;;;;
2501;for me it's just not worth it;;;;
2502;enter the food peddler farmer's market;;;;
2503;i don't know whose idea it was to plop down a produce-centric farmer's market style grocery store in the heart of cleveland's old brooklyn neighborhood but i'd like to shake their hand;;;;
2504;it's just what the doctor ordered;;;;
2505;imagine if you will a bright airy open market full of colorful fruit and vegetables from farms around the region rows of farm fresh eggs coolers filled with amish chicken and local ground beef;;;;
2506;yeah right;;;;
2507;no really it's true;;;;
2508;i'm not saying this place is perfect but for an area of cleveland more known for it's shady strip mall bars and giant cemeteries it's a breath of fresh air;;;;
2509;it does what cleveland and the rest of the nation needs it encourages consumption of fresh local foods;;;;
2510;so what do they have to offer?;;;;
2511;#NAME?;;;;
2512;#NAME?;;;;
2513;#NAME?;;;;
2514;#NAME?;;;;
2515;#NAME?;;;;
2516;#NAME?;;;;
2517;it's not as cheap as fast food no;;;;
2518;but if you're gonna spend your money somewhere why not make it your health;;;;
2519;i could go on and on about all of the products they've managed to cram into this place and about how friendly the staff was but i want to leave something for you to find out on your first visit;;;;
2520;i know it's not the west side market and it doesn't have nearly the sheer volume of items of this venerable food mecca but it's worth paying them a visit anyway;;;;
2521;what it does have is a neighborhood feel more parking and a more intimate experience;;;;
2522;support a local business eat local foods and give something back;;;;
2523;oh man this is going to be a long review so if you want the gist god awful do not go;;;;
2524;i was so dissapointed with everything that once i got home i had to write a review;;;;
2525;first of all i am vietnamese and pho is such a soulful dish the pho i had today was the worst thing ever;;;;
2526;my parents came to visit with my sister and a friend and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho;;;;
2527;i have seen this place i have even walked by it when i ate at sura;;;;
2528;there was a smell so tantalizing that i had to go and try it;;;;
2529;i thought it would be a good idea to try jenni pho grill tonight;;;;
2530;we walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables;;;;
2531;we got seated fairly quickly;;;;
2532;our server was pretty nice my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it;;;;
2533;cool cool no big deal he seemed like a nice kid;;;;
2534;after that it went downhill from there;;;;
2535;we ordered three bowls of the pho dac biet and two orders of the pho tai;;;;
2536;we finished our order with two thai teas the jenni jelly drink and two waters;;;;
2537;my family waited around no waters no drinks nothing;;;;
2538;we watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait our waiter finally comes back with two waters;;;;
2539;we asked why the service was so slow he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry;;;;
2540;so it was fine for now;;;;
2541;after we got the water nothing else came to us;;;;
2542;we watched as the tables that came in after us eat and one even finished before we were served;;;;
2543;after another 35 minutes our food finally came out;;;;
2544;first the two dac biet bowls then the last three;;;;
2545;finally the drinks came out as well;;;;
2546;i have worked at a boba place before making thai teas should not take a hour;;;;
2547;for waiting for so long i was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho;;;;
2548;oh man was i wrong;;;;
2549;the broth was lukewarm it could not even finish cooking my meat;;;;
2550;the broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder;;;;
2551;my parents and i watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth and we saw no bones that make a great broth;;;;
2552;the bowl was mostly disappointing broth;;;;
2553;there were very little meat and noodles;;;;
2554;we ate and we wanted to get out as soon as possible;;;;
2555;we asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home;;;;
2556;it took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup;;;;
2557;in the end it was just terrible;;;;
2558;my family and i went home unhappy;;;;
2559;and the thing is i love food i work in the industry so i timing is very important;;;;
2560;having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse;;;;
2561;if there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer they should inform the customers;;;;
2562;the worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything;;;;
2563;i am never going back;;;;
2564;i really hope they clean up their act there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest;;;;
2565;great wings  and the breakfast is pretty good also;;;;
2566;the cook does a great job on the food;;;;
2567;i don't drink so i can't say anything about that but over all a good neighborhood place;;;;
2568;worst service ever;;;;
2569;only one here and took 10 minutes to get one drink out;;;;
2570;3 people behind the counter including the manager;;;;
2571;they were all talking and doing other things;;;;
2572;driving late at night we were lucky to find the last room available at this location;;;;
2573;the front desk clerk breanne was super nice and helpful;;;;
2574;the hotel felt welcoming and clean walking in and the room was no different! i'd definitely stay again;;;;
2575;we did not explore the other amenities;;;;
2576;christian and joe!! 5 stars!;;;;
2577;thanks for the quick resolution!;;;;
2578;got the tech scheduled as best they could as quick they could and we're professional the whole time;;;;
2579;their is a bit of a disconnect from the moment you arrive in the parking lot as the signage makes a cool sophisticated impression that does not match the semi-bland interior;;;;
2580;this could be any of the relatively higher chain restos that feels like it needs an update but maybe that's just me?;;;;
2581;the food is the thing in any restaurant and pretty much everything was just ok;;;;
2582;our salesman/server;;;;
2583;) confidently stated the steak tacos were the best menu item and they were but still only rated a just above average 3;;;;
2584;i had a ribeye with mashed and seasonal vegetables that was not coked to medium as requested (who knows why they ask in spots like this because it is pretty much never done right?);;;;
2585;the accompanying sauce was actually very good and that saved this dish for me;;;;
2586;if union social was located closer to where we live it might merit another chance but we live in the south end of mississauga and thus will be sticking closer to home;;;;
2587;--look at my picture!!!;;;;
2588;this is a picture of an **insect that i was about to eat!! i was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat;;;;
2589;thank goodness this was my second plate and i wasn't too full because i gulped down the first plate;;;;
2590;this is your soup of toscana that i was served;;;;
2591;management provided a friendly compensation but i don't want anyone to get poisoned sooo yeah eat at your own risk!!;;;;
2592;im obsessed with this place! best dishes to try include;;;;
2593;pozole- which is really filling! great for when is freezing outside;;;;
2594;tacos dorados- they are the best ones i have tried in the city!;;;;
2595;enchiladas during the morning on weekends are the best as well delicious! and if you really want to try real huevos rancheros try them here!!!!! there are some other places in the neighbourhood to claim to offer them and trust me none of the are authentic as they are here;;;;
2596;always a great experience keep the good work! prices are so good also considering the freshness and quality of food one of the best places to eat without breaking your pocket;;;;
2597;the challah french toast paired with turkey bacon was a pretty awesome breakfast and i thoroughly enjoyed it;;;;
2598;however i felt the staff was lacking in service;;;;
2599;they were very nice just not very prompt and would disappear for quite some time;;;;
2600;i don't know if it was because a few people called out and they were short-staffed or if one should plan to stay awhile;;;;
2601;the food is very good though;;;;
2602;trã¨s grand cafã© mais aussi calme et reposant je m'y suis arrãªtã© alors que j'ã©tais dans le coin;;;;
2603;on peu y mangã© le midi prendre une pã¢tisserie ou un cafã©/thã©;;;;
2604;j'ai prit un thã© qui ã©tait vraiment bon et je me suis posã© devant une des grandes baies vitrã©es sur un coussin et j'ai relaxã© complã¨tement pendant 2 heures;;;;
2605;mais c'est aussi une coopã©rative d'artiste avec une estrade etc;;;;
2606;il y a aussi un magasin bio ã  l'entrã©e oã¹ vous retrouverez des savons huile d'olive et plein d'autres produits;;;;
2607;the food was great our server karu was the bomb he was cool very nice and good looking guy;;;;
2608;it's the perfect spot for the bring friends and group;;;;
2609;great atmosphere and great menu choices;;;;
2610;spicy;;;;
2611;but its good haha;;;;
2612;defenitely coming back!!!;;;;
2613;chilaquiles is on point;;;;
2614;i bought them last and saved them for breakfast today;;;;
2615;the sauce and tortillas were so good!;;;;
2616;i e-mailed head office months ago about a lousy experience at their yonge & college street location and never received a response;;;;
2617;was never a huge fan to begin with but that confirmed things for me;;;;
2618;oh and the cobb salad doesn't have chicken in it anymore;;;;
2619;what a rip off!;;;;
2620;awful;;;;
2621;nearly inedible;;;;
2622;even for airport food;;;;
2623;"don't push the ""prompt service"" button on the table";;;;
2624;the waitress said that they ignore it;;;;
2625;keep walking;;;;
2626;much better coffee than the big chains;;;;
2627;this is a great place for a quick lunch or breakfast and the drive through makes caffeine fill ups easy;;;;
2628;i used to work for skechers in las vegas years ago;;;;
2629;everything at this store is the same;;;;
2630;except this store is much smaller! especially the clearance section;;;;
2631;i tried on some shoes;;;;
2632;and that was it really;;;;
2633;we were greeted but no one checked up on me blah oh well;;;;
2634;this restaurant is a real local secret;;;;
2635;open since 1965 the original owner and chef was still cooking in the kitchen on a monday night at 10;;;;
2636;00 when most restaurants were closed;;;;
2637;so happy i found it;;;;
2638;amazing food wonderful authentic italian atmosphere and friendly and well-timed  service in english french or italian!;;;;
2639;just a couple days ago i adopted my little sayuri from the arizona humane society;;;;
2640;the entire process was seamless and it was evident it was in the societies best interest to make sure these lovable pets find the right home;;;;
2641;i first went in to see a couple of puppies and i really like 2 in particular;;;;
2642;because i already have a dog at home and my boyfriend wasn't able to join me i put one of them on hold (they will hold your pet for the day) and went back a few hours later;;;;
2643;it is required that if you already have a dog you must do an introduction to make sure it is a good match;;;;
2644;my dog loved sayuri but was not as fond of the other dog;;;;
2645;i like to say that my dog chose our new puppy;;;;
2646;when adopting a puppy you also recieve a free exam through the vca animal hospitals;;;;
2647;i think that's wonderful since adopting a rescue dog can be intimidating;;;;
2648;overall the facility is extremely clean the staff is more than helpful and on top of it all they are about as friendly as you can imagine;;;;
2649;these people have hearts of gold;;;;
2650;i would absolutely recommend the az humane society to anyone who wants to add to their family;;;;
2651;this is for service only;;;;
2652;on a 2000 honda accord vtec ex;;;;
2653;had major service done here;;;;
2654;timing belt water pump tune up etc;;;;
2655;basically everything that was recommended and told needed to be done;;;;
2656;wanted the car to be reliable and not have any issues so i went ahead with all the required maintenance and then some;;;;
2657;1 month after all this major service the radiator blew open coming back from flagstaff;;;;
2658;ok so i understand things break etc;;;;
2659;i take it to arrowhead honda service and the explanation was since i replaced the water pump with a new one it must have increased pressure in the system;;;;
2660;since the radiator was old the new water pump found a weakness in the radiator;;;;
2661;i was then told it was common??? ok i get the explanation but if that was the case a month a go and common knowledge why not recommend replacing the radiator with the major service so the car would not leave me stranded???;;;;
2662;they also had recommended the power steering pump be replaced system flushed etc;;;;
2663;hate when its not done right the first time?  had to bring it back and wait for them to get air out of the system so the new power steering pump would stop making noise;;;;
2664;i went to this dealership service department because they know honda's better then me and what breaks unfortunately even when i changed everything they initially recommended they still missed other items that should of been changed;;;;
2665;i have not been back since this mistake;;;;
2666;roach and staff are wonderful;;;;
2667;keisha is an amazing groomer too! we love this place;;;;
2668;it is clean efficient and a state of the art facility;;;;
2669;i love this location;;;;
2670;christina was our server this morning and she was fantastic;;;;
2671;as a former waitress i understand how hectic and overwhelming a morning shift can get but she was attentive and very friendly and always kept her cool even with the tons of tables she had;;;;
2672;the food was brought to us within ten minutes of ordering (successfully taming the hangry beast that was brewing) and any modification to our order was done correctly! the food itself was pretty good;;;;
2673;#NAME?;;;;
2674;overall i was very impressed with this recent visit;;;;
2675;keep up the good work!;;;;
2676;good luck getting an appointment  before you end up in the e;;;;
2677;i'm not into seafood but it was my husbands birthday and he loves it;;;;
2678;there were other options then seafood that made me happy;;;;
2679;and my husband said his was great;;;;
2680;this review is for just the gym facilities as i've never tried the tanning or purchased any products;;;;
2681;there's a solid array of cardio equipment weight machines and free weights (including an olympic lifting platform/power cage combo with bumper plates another power cage and a smith machine);;;;
2682;the pros;;;;
2683;24 hours access with your keycard;;;;
2684;no-contract membership options;;;;
2685;lockers (bring your own lock);;;;
2686;sweat towels provided;;;;
2687;friendly employees;;;;
2688;the cons;;;;
2689;no showers;;;;
2690;inconsistent membership rates (my friends got quoted several different rates than what i pay);;;;
2691;small space can get packed;;;;
2692;some of the equipment is showing signs of wear (ripped pads on weight machines and cracks in the weight benches pads and the numbers have rubbed off on some of the dumbbells so you can't tell what the weight is;;;;
2693;i wouldn't think it would be that hard to slap some stickers on there but it's been that way for months;;;;
2694;often dirty - especially the mirrors in front of the power cages which always have peoples' spit sprayed all over them;;;;
2695;i have personally wiped weird black/brown splotches off the olympic lifting platform (are people shitting themselves during squats??) and it's always built up again the next time i go;;;;
2696;overall it's a decent gym that gets the job done if you live in the area;;;;
2697;the service was pretty bad;;;;
2698;there were these two grouchy ladies dealing with us at the entrance and we have to wait ridiculously long for a table even though the restaurant is almost empty;;;;
2699;then we have to sit as far away from the food as possible;;;;
2700;when we ask to sit closer they say no;;;;
2701;we ask why and they say no one is covering that area;;;;
2702;seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception i mean its a buffet;;;;
2703;we won't be needing much service if any;;;;
2704;luckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas;;;;
2705;the food at the buffet was one of the better buffets i've had in vegas definitely better than monte carlo's or harrah's but nothing compared to paris or mirage;;;;
2706;i was told caesar's palace is the best but i've never had it;;;;
2707;from the looks of it i'm sure its a million times better than this place;;;;
2708;if you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's;;;;
2709;we got a great deal from tix4tonight;;;;
2710;definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in vegas;;;;
2711;one really cool feature here is the salad bar where they make you a salad fresh for you;;;;
2712;i really enjoyed the chinese chicken salad;;;;
2713;there's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets though the execution of them aren't so great;;;;
2714;definitely worth going to for the food but i really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants i went to in vegas;;;;
2715;for those reasons i probably won't go back but i wouldn't tell people not to go;;;;
2716;my companion and i went to living kitchen on an impulse and am very happy to say it was delicious and worth it! my companion got the arugula harvest salad and i got the pad thai;;;;
2717;the arugula harvest salad was very tasty and all of the components came together well;;;;
2718;the pad thai was also very flavorful and had an awesome sauce which had a good afterburn to it;;;;
2719;i would highly recommend coming here to try the food vegan vegetarian or otherwise;;;;
2720;why do these guys suck? how hard is it to ring a bell to see if the receiver is home?  i've had multiple issues with them and wish amazon would stop using them;;;;
2721;this place brings back so many memories with my family;;;;
2722;it has been here for years and unfortunately the service and food quality has gone down;;;;
2723;during my recent visit i noticed they closed down the second half of the seating area which is disappointing in my book;;;;
2724;i go here with my family and we are usually big party so they would  accommodated just fine but now we had to separate the family and sit at different tables or booths just to all fit;;;;
2725;poor choice in closing the extra room after all these years;;;;
2726;the service for the food depends on the day and if glendale is hosting a event;;;;
2727;i don't recommend lunch or dinner here but the breakfast is like any ordinary restaurant;;;;
2728;i was on  cleanse one weekend and they were awesome enough to give me egg whites even though it wasn't on the menu;;;;
2729;we went for brunch;;;;
2730;shrimp sushi snow crab legs crepes made to order prime rib etc;;;;
2731;etc;;;;
2732;add all you can drink mimosas and we were loving it;;;;
2733;00 for two after tip;;;;
2734;would go back for sure;;;;
2735;this is the worst gym i've ever been to and i've grown up in the gym business;;;;
2736;these guys only care about your money and nothing more;;;;
2737;when i joined i later had to cancel with them because i had to meet with my national guard unit and i didn't know what kind of schedule i'd have;;;;
2738;they seemed understanding and said it wasn't a problem;;;;
2739;at this time i would have rated this gym very good because i had fun with no issues;;;;
2740;i even told them i'd probably start back up here after i know what schedule looked like;;;;
2741;so i stop going after my month expired because i cancelled(even on my attendance sheet it said it was my last and only month;;;;
2742;) i later check my bank statement and they charged me again okay no big deal probably a mistake;;;;
2743;i call them no answer;;;;
2744;okay that's fine i'll email them explaining the mistake;;;;
2745;i'll give them a few days to get back to me max;;;;
2746;hear nothing from them;;;;
2747;call them again no answer;;;;
2748;call them again they finally answered;;;;
2749;"i explain the situation with guy that answers and he says ""oh yeah i got your email but i forgot to call you";;;;
2750;at this point i'm a little rubbed wrong with they're crap customer service;;;;
2751;then after that he tells me no i haven't cancelled and i'm going to have to pay another two months worth;;;;
2752;he tells me i must have misunderstood him (he speaks broken english so he must have misunderstood me when i cancelled with him a month prior to this);;;;
2753;he won't help me out at all just says i have to pay more;;;;
2754;thank god i have navy federal for a bank because i call them after this and they let me know these guys shouldn't be changing me;;;;
2755;they repay me for what the gym took and put a dispute on the gym they also put a stop payment on the gym;;;;
2756;well sure and behold i get charged by them again and i call my bank asking why did this happen? turns out this gym is manually putting my card information in to get past the stop payment;;;;
2757;i ask what i can do;;;;
2758;they say to email them so i have proof i contacted them in case they try to lie;;;;
2759;so i email these dirt bags and guess what once again nothing but they email me the schedule for the classes;;;;
2760;once again my bank is helping me thank goodness;;;;
2761;not veteran friendly;;;;
2762;freaking bomb macaroni & cheese and everything else was awesome as well great service again everything was outstanding;;;;
2763;i ordered the akropolis pizza and pork gyro;;;;
2764;the first thing i noticed when the pizza came out was how vibrant the toppings were! you can tell the veggies are fresh just by looking at them;;;;
2765;the gyro was one of the best i've had and the fries were awesome;;;;
2766;great service! they really care about giving you a good experience;;;;
2767;i will definitely be back!;;;;
2768;worst experience ever;;;;
2769;i guess it's my first time left negative comments but definitely for me won't go back anymore;;;;
2770;i have made reservation for the day and when i arrive they told me they don't remember they have confirmed my appointment n already other guests waiting there but they re closing in a hour;;;;
2771;still the lady told me it's ok they could do it;;;;
2772;so i sit down n soak my feet into cold water;;;;
2773;n after 20 mins the lady told me n another girl that actually they could not help us today as they re closing soon n one of the staff actually have to leave soon;;;;
2774;so i don't know how good they re as i guess i ll never know;;;;
2775;so let me start out;;;;
2776;the ambiance of the facility is amazing;;;;
2777;very classy;;;;
2778;but that doesn't compensate for the service i received;;;;
2779;i was the first person at the door and when we walk in we're notified that there is a 30 minute wait for preparation;;;;
2780;i honestly feel they should have came in 30 mins earlier instead of making a customer wait;;;;
2781;i was a little disappointed that 2 groups of women with sundresses came in 30 mins after me and received their food before me;;;;
2782;there has to be a happy medium;;;;
2783;"it's not right to let the ""sex sells"" slogan consume your site of all customers being treated fairly and equally";;;;
2784;to be honest i wish had just went to ihop but i tried to be a good person and support black business;;;;
2785;this place will not be recommended to anybody i know;;;;
2786;the food on a scale of a 1-10 was a 7 if the service was better i'd give a 8;;;;
2787;my meal was the salmon and grits;;;;
2788;being an avid hookah smoker with a pipe of my own i probably have a little more knowledge about shisha and the procedures than i need with that being known this place doesn't clean the pipes after each use and as stated with another review it really doesn't matter a whole lot what flavor you are interested in double apple is what you will eventually end up tasting;;;;
2789;they use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal;;;;
2790;being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied i understand why they use ql's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning;;;;
2791;i could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab;;;;
2792;so i'll sum it up quick if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke;;;;
2793;if you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? you know how it's done do it up right;;;;
2794;moving to their food and drink selections;;;;
2795;my fiancee and i have tried most of their juices and found them to be on the whole quite good;;;;
2796;their oasis cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and i order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue;;;;
2797;my fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit;;;;
2798;the hummus was flavored pretty well and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right;;;;
2799;my last visit there i had shawarma and it was good;;;;
2800;pretty solid foods drinks desserts and hookah;;;;
2801;laid back atmosphere heaters outside when it gets too cold;;;;
2802;the only thing that could use a smidge improvement is the serving girls are a tad hard to find and you can potentially go 30-45 minutes without seeing one anywhere;;;;
2803;give this place a shot if you're near the area;;;;
2804;will not offer refund and will charge you for cancelled flight;;;;
2805;even a month in advance i tried and they will not work with me;;;;
2806;dont use this cut rate airline;;;;
2807;better than hot & juicy and boiling crab;;;;
2808;they would have gotten 5 starts from me but they forgot my crab legs! the main reason i wanted to come here;;;;
2809;it was disappointing but the flavors are really good and the seafood was very fresh;;;;
2810;i love that they use real butter in the sauce and not margarine like all the other crawfish spots!! so this will be my new seafood spot;;;;
2811;the nicest hotel i've ever stayed in in vegas! found a great deal during the week and couldn't pass it up;;;;
2812;clean staff is friendly and there's so much food to choose from downstairs! pretty convenient location on the strip as well;;;;
2813;definitely will stay here again;;;;
2814;a wonderful dinner experience! hubby and i came couple months ago it was our first time at sushi samba;;;;
2815;we didn't have reservations but they were able to seat us at the sushi bar;;;;
2816;we had the a5 wagyu gyoza was tender and not overdone tuna tataki chicken samba was a good size portion el topo roll chef sashimi selections and tonkotsu ramen;;;;
2817;everything we order was super yummy!  definitely coming back again next time we're in town!!;;;;
2818;i would recommend making reservations next time the sushi bar is kind of tight and if you order a good amount of food not too much room;;;;
2819;danielle was the perfect server - always smiling and came around enough but not too much made good suggestions and generally let us be silly nearby table neighbors were great food was fresh and tasty;;;;
2820;i had the crab topped chicken which was juicy and flavorful;;;;
2821;the man had ravioli something that was also tasty - fresh pasta and good meat sauce;;;;
2822;the salad and soup and breadsticks are always wonderful;;;;
2823;we also got the bruschetta which was really perfect - not specialty not gourmet just perfectly normal fresh tasting tomato basil and olive oil yumminess;;;;
2824;we also had a trio of their dolcini desserts which made it perfect so we could have tiramisu and the limoncello and strawberry stuff!;;;;
2825;overall even though it was really busy and we waited for about 20 minutes for a table (although 'waiting' in the bar having a drink hardly counts as waiting) with the excellent service and great food this place definitely gets 5 stars from me and for a chain restaurant that is definitely something!;;;;
2826;i'm truly disgusted by the service of this restaurant;;;;
2827;i came in with my family (mom and dad) and they said 10 minute wait we said okay we notice that they were short with their staff so we waited patiently till we were seated at a table but that 10 minutes turned into a 30min wait;;;;
2828;so the hostess sat us at a table saying how there may be awhile wait after seeing 2 servers walk by us like we didn't exist the hostess later seated another table which were 4 caucasian customers we were still patiently waited for around another 30min when those 4 sat down an asian waiter quickly came to take their order i got the waiters attention and said excuse me we came here first;;;;
2829;"and she made up an excuse saying how ""oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy"" i knew this was an excuse i was so disgusted";;;;
2830;"so we told the hostess that this waiter is waiting on a table after us and she said oh well we said there would probably be a long wait and the hostess had the audacity to say ""oh but they serve the people who come before"" and i said we were before them we been waiting 30min at this table and you know this because you sat us at our table"" she said it depends";;;;
2831;so in the end we left the restaurant hungry and went to a much better restaurant which served us very well called rice paper;;;;
2832;review #189 - 2016;;;;
2833;we arrived at hertz at around 2;;;;
2834;15 pm on aug;;;;
2835;24th and was able to get our rental in about 20-25 minutes;;;;
2836;the pick up process is pretty simple;;;;
2837;you can either go to a customer service rep or use their self-serve kiosk which is what i ended up doing;;;;
2838;the lady who was assisting me on the kiosk phone was pretty friendly but she was doing a lot of up-sell so it was kind of bothersome;;;;
2839;i didn't need a bigger car than an economy size since there was only 2 of us;;;;
2840;i understand that they probably work off of commission but sometimes it's unnecessary to try and convince you to get something that you don't need;;;;
2841;the return process was pretty quick and easy as well;;;;
2842;i ended up getting charged for an extra day because i brought the car back 1;;;;
2843;5 hours after the pick up time since my flight didn't leave until 8 pm;;;;
2844;"too bad they don't have a ""grace"" period for regular customers";;;;
2845;other than that the car was fine;;;;
2846;i didn't get anything fancy just a kia so nothing much to write about--other than the fact that it was clean and didn't smell bad like some other rentals that i've encountered elsewhere;;;;
2847;these are sooo good!  i'm having bulgogi dog cravings right now!  so tasty!  want to go back and try the carne asada fries too!  see you soon!;;;;
2848;had the occasion over the last few weeks to experience their sports medicine/physical therapy department;;;;
2849;outstanding;;;;
2850;drs;;;;
2851;"anthony ""tony"" walker and jennifer hannon are a great team";;;;
2852;they really know their stuff;;;;
2853;beyond knowing their stuff is their continual dialogue with patients;;;;
2854;on each appointment we began discussing how the exercises were working how i was feeling what is working or not;;;;
2855;then we would get into planning for that day and going forward;;;;
2856;i was involved in the therapy;;;;
2857;and we continued in this joint planning over a month of treatments;;;;
2858;they administer a tablet form of survey asking about your condition and how it is affecting your life;;;;
2859;after the therapy has run its course you complete the same survey so they have a before and after record of your condition;;;;
2860;impressive and given the people cycling through this practice it was clear that the facility and all the therapists were doing something special;;;;
2861;good resource for most all of us;;;;
2862;q absolutely astonishing my windows became corrupted i had a lot of problems with the computer came to my house and fix all the problems my computer is like it should be really fast;;;;
2863;he's extremely knowledgeable;;;;
2864;and honest i will absolutely be using him again and again;;;;
2865;this is such a great attraction!!! my 13 year old son loves all things marvel - it made the highlight of our trip! staff are very helpful and the venue makes you feel like you are in the middle of the movie!;;;;
2866;my family and i visited and decided to take some pictures with the green screen so they can edit in the avengers in them afterwards;;;;
2867;since this was our first time visiting this place the staff was very patient and helped guide us;;;;
2868;when we went to go check out which ones to print agent collins was a great help;;;;
2869;we loved his easy going personality and he has great customer service! 10/10 would visit again;;;;
2870;the pics came out very nice too! thank you agent collins;;;;
2871;continue to show your awesome personality and great customer service! very much appreciated;;;;
2872;i used to come here a lot;;;;
2873;it was the best boba place around here but lately the tea just taste like water sugar and flavor;;;;
2874;there is no tea taste but the texture of boba is good;;;;
2875;the squid balls are still great;;;;
2876;but i guess if you like slush and blended drinks its still good;;;;
2877;i will still come because its the closest by my house;;;;
2878;it used to be 8;;;;
2879;99 for a haircut;;;;
2880;it's now 9;;;;
2881;99 and that's cheaper compared to other hair places still however this place isn't as professional as the other ones i've been too;;;;
2882;employees talking over my head and seriously 5 minute haircuts;;;;
2883;i don't understand;;;;
2884;last time i went they refused to take me even though they were still open;;;;
2885;an hour before closing hours still open;;;;
2886;i stood there in front of the glass door while the lady swept by me ignoring me;;;;
2887;i was disappointed about that but went back since second chances exists;;;;
2888;i went a couple more times and wasn't too happy about the service and cut;;;;
2889;i'm giving it three stars because the price is cheap and the quality is cheaper;;;;
2890;this show was fun but i was expecting more from all the hype it gets;;;;
2891;we picked this over chippendales cuz the idea of australian men with their accents is so much hotter than american dancers =p;;;;
2892;when i called in to purchase tickets an hour before the show they said that they didn't have a table to fit 5 girls and that we would have to separate into two tables which was fine;;;;
2893;but when we got there there was 2 completely empty tables in the front of the stage! the sales people were really unorganized to not notice that was available! so we ditched our booth and went straight to the front table which gave a much better view;;;;
2894;the show was def entertaining with finely sculpted men ripping off their shirts and dressing up in firemen/spartan outfits;;;;
2895;) the occasional view of g-strings was not as welcome something about a man in a g-string is just wrong you know? but nonetheless it was very entertaining;;;;
2896;the emcee's accent was hot and so was his bod;;;;
2897;i think i found him the most attractive out of all the guys;;;;
2898;they pulled a lot of the bachelorettes and birthday girls onstage to participate and some of the older women too which i thought was cool;;;;
2899;they also ran around through the audience as well so no matter where your seats were i think you'd be able to get up close with one of the guys;;;;
2900;downside though at the end of the show you are welcome to go to the front of the stage and pay $20 per person to take a pic with the guys only to receive one picture;;;;
2901;no offense but that is a total rip off;;;;
2902;i've been to fantasy which is a female stripshow  and you can take pics with them for free and they had much better attitudes and were a lot friendlier to talk to after the show;;;;
2903;they were annoyed that we had stood in like and decided against taking the picture after the show and even more annoyed when a girl behind us asked if they took credit card;;;;
2904;wtf? these men seemed way too jaded and full of themselves;;;;
2905;they may be good to look at but off-stage they're total jerks;;;;
2906;was this a good show? it was ok it was entertaining and interactive which i thought was nice;;;;
2907;would i go again though? probably not;;;;
2908;next time i'm trying chippendales;;;;
2909;maybe their attitudes will be better;;;;
2910;i have dined here teppan twice a la carte twice;;;;
2911;the teppan is very well priced and great food but the chef's are tired;;;;
2912;understandable;;;;
2913;there is not the same type of showmanship you can get elsewhere but they are good chefs;;;;
2914;a la carte sushi is great;;;;
2915;pot of soup is huge and delicious;;;;
2916;this is a local place that does well;;;;
2917;service was on point and very attentive last time i came here;;;;
2918;"came in because our toronto friends insisted on drinking some ""gator bait"" before we left to go home";;;;
2919;this place screams new orleans to me and the service is friendly just like the south;;;;
2920;we sat at the bar and drank and we were able to see them shuck oysters right in front of us pretty cool;;;;
2921;didn't try the food but the menu looked tasty will try it when we are back in town;;;;
2922;"but the ""gator bait"" drink was delicious!";;;;
2923;absolutely no complaints! stayed in the bella suite with a view;;;;
2924;it was a fantastic room;;;;
2925;amazing service and friendly staff;;;;
2926;the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is room service;;;;
2927;yeah yeah i know and can expect to pay higher prices for room service food but $34 for hot tea and doughnuts (ouch!) they charge $5 for room service but i think that should be free;;;;
2928;the food here is the best greek food i've had in arizona;;;;
2929;the prices aren't too bad and the service was great;;;;
2930;they are really fast too!!;;;;
2931;this pita jungle is located in the food court at the scottsdale fashion square mall;;;;
2932;out of all the eateries in the food court this is by far and away the healthiest;;;;
2933;there are some vegetarian and vegan options for those looking for a meat-free dish;;;;
2934;the lentil soup is super yum and they have some great dishes i haven't seen anywhere else;;;;
2935;they have several locations in the valley;;;;
2936;the one on ray and dobson has a patio right next to a small lake;;;;
2937;it's a great location but can get crazy busy especially during lunch on the weekends or on gorgeous days;;;;
2938;went here on new years day to grab a burger;;;;
2939;got in before the osu game started;;;;
2940;tasty $5 cocktails (in pint glasses mind you) and good burgers;;;;
2941;the fries have large grain salt and were well prepared;;;;
2942;i had the oh cheesus which is a burger to be reckoned with;;;;
2943;seems a bit like a rip off from melt but i didn't care it's a burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches (with more cheese on top of the burger);;;;
2944;i made it healthier by adding spinach on top;;;;
2945;basically health food at that point;;;;
2946;i'll be back!;;;;
2947;this is a really quaint place for the whole family!  rows of pinball machines- some vintage some modern;;;;
2948;there are also other various arcade games like super mario bros;;;;
2949;and centipede;;;;
2950;crane games for all your plushie needs;;;;
2951;coin machines to turn your bills into coins for the machines;;;;
2952;vending machines in case you are feeling hungry or thirsty while you play;;;;
2953;staff walks around to make sure machines are running as they should and refund you if one of them fails while you are playing;;;;
2954;towards the back there are more older pinball machines that seem to be out of order or in the process of restoration;;;;
2955;really neat to see!  i believe there is also a prize counter in the back though i'm not sure how that would work;;;;
2956;it is a dimly lit building which allows the lights of the machines to illuminate the area;;;;
2957;great place to hang out and play some good ol' fashioned arcade games;;;;
2958;i understand las vegas is over-priced;;;;
2959;but $50 for a pitcher of mediocre sangria - more than 1/2 way filled with ice - with not a slice of fruit in sight?  annoying;;;;
2960;friendly staff;;;;
2961;my food (fish tacos) was not nearly as good as the time i had it before;;;;
2962;it is conveniently located very close to the convention center so it gets packed when events are going on;;;;
2963;love coming back to this location one of the best ones i've been to;;;;
2964;have tried other buffalo's and they don't top the service from the metro center store;;;;
2965;we always get helped out by chelsea and she is awesome always has a smile and makes us feel at home also the team captains are always checking to see if we are good with our orders and drinks;;;;
2966;there are better and worse y's for sure;;;;
2967;this place is nothing compared to dowd or davidson but it does the job;;;;
2968;i would give another star but i've just been told they are raising the already high price;;;;
2969;plus people don't seem to understand the one way signs in the parking lot or just the parking lot in general;;;;
2970;i've def been honked and yelled at for following the rules;;;;
2971;the front desk help are always pleasant once you get to them;;;;
2972;i normally don't have the best of interactions with other patrons while waiting in line but that seems to be the idea on this side of town;;;;
2973;the locker rooms are decent nothing special;;;;
2974;plenty of open lockers most times of the day;;;;
2975;you will rarely find yourself solo in the sauna or steam rooms;;;;
2976;i've only swam here once i need to get on that;;;;
2977;i've never used the basketball courts or anything outside;;;;
2978;i stick to the weight room;;;;
2979;i have never had to wait on a bike or a treadmill;;;;
2980;if i'm looking for a stair climber that can be another story though;;;;
2981;the bikes are no where near as nice as the dowd;;;;
2982;the only thing i ever have to wait on are the free weights;;;;
2983;there's plenty of weights but not much room at all to use them;;;;
2984;if you want a lay down bench you will probably have to wait especially at peak hours;;;;
2985;all in all it is what it is;;;;
2986;its close so this is where i go;;;;
2987;plus there is a 24 hour harris teeter right there where nobody looks at you funny for being sweaty in gym clothes;;;;
2988;but if somebody calls me asking if i want to go to a nicer location i do;;;;
2989;went here as a last resort because a hose on my son's truck busted and we were stuck;;;;
2990;they usually ask for a 24 hour turn-around but because we had kids in the nevada desert heat they made the hose with clamps etc;;;;
2991;in about 20 minutes;;;;
2992;great service and the part which no auto parts store could replicate (strangely) was done perfectly;;;;
2993;super nice guys not expensive at all and they really saved the day;;;;
2994;thank you guys you're awesome!;;;;
2995;the food was very good;;;;
2996;the waitress was very inventive;;;;
2997;the only thing is my i felt so sick after eating it;;;;
2998;i'm not sure if it's just my stomach not being able to handle it or what but i felt terrible;;;;
2999;the staff at the front was very friendly and talkative;;;;
3000;looked forward to eating here for so long;;;;
3001;too bad it was on my birthday - food was good but the service was deplorable so not going to rehash this too much (apologies to my man and bro as i know they were also hoping for better);;;;
3002;the appetizers were by far the best thing - the entree's were good with red meat being the star;;;;
3003;peach cobbler desert was all topping that i swear was merely microwaved and had one slice of grilled peach - putting a candle on it did nothing to make me think this was the birthday dessert i was for;;;;
3004;i highly recommend the flight of 10 20 30 & 40 yr old ports - this mellowed out the complete waste of skin that was our server;;;;
3005;not sure if he thought we looked unable to tip for a spendy bill or weren't as enthralled as the table next to us with his montana stories but my brother aptly reconfirmed his tip expectation with 7% - too much in my opinion for not giving diddley about someone chosing their restaurant to celebrate in;;;;
3006;hy steakhouse is a contemporary and elegant  traditional steak house with lots of open space and an intimate dinning experience;;;;
3007;we started with the famous cheese toast oyster rockerfeller which was 6  sweet and savory but very small oysters;;;;
3008;and the beef tartare which was made table side and served with small biscuits;;;;
3009;we ended off with the 22 oz;;;;
3010;porterhouse steak which was cooked perfectly to order and was more than enough for the both of us;;;;
3011;our server was friendly and insightful and always catered to our needs at the table other servers were also helpful but tended to their own tables;;;;
3012;although there were several mistakes on our bill initially such as wrong food and drinks and extra items being billed our server fixed everything easily;;;;
3013;the room itself was dimmed and the ambiance was more intimate;;;;
3014;in conclusion the food quality is above standard service and cleanliness is high and the atmosphere is intimate;;;;
3015;the food is more old fashioned come here for a great steak done right at a slightly higher price range than the keg;;;;
3016;mr cool heating and air conditioning came to the rescue for me on short notice and was able to work on a swamp cooler which many companies do not;;;;
3017;we have three dogs of our own and we foster dogs so when it started to heat up here in vegas we were worried when the swamp cooler didn't seem to be blowing out air as cold as it normally does;;;;
3018;i started reading reviews and messaging companies on yelp to see who if any would work on swamp coolers;;;;
3019;the answer is very few do and most of the ones that do charge a high fee just to come take a look and provide an estimate and often that fee doesn't apply towards the repair cost;;;;
3020;mr cool didn't charge me an estimate fee and they had derek come out to my house the very next day;;;;
3021;derek was thorough and investigated the problem and explained everything that was wrong without being condescending or acting like i was clueless;;;;
3022;he offered his estimate for service and even told me i could shop around for other estimates to be certain i was getting a good price;;;;
3023;i had already shopped around a bit so i was happy to proceed with their help;;;;
3024;swamp cooler parts are very large so they don't have space to keep them in their vans but derek assured me he could buy the parts and complete the repair the very next day;;;;
3025;i explained that my husband and myself would need to wait until friday when we were getting paid for repair and he was kind enough to work with us so we could come to an arrangement for payment so we wouldn't have to deal with our house being so hot;;;;
3026;he came back the next day and was here for a good amount of time as swamp coolers take more time for repair and he was very thorough and explained everything to me again;;;;
3027;i asked questions about how to best maintenance our swamp cooler and he was happy to answer;;;;
3028;i'm very glad we chose mr cool and would highly recommend derek as he was so patient kind and hardworking;;;;
3029;swamp coolers are a pain for repair so if they were affordable for our repair i'm sure they're even better with ac units;;;;
3030;thank you derek and mr cool our house gets soooo cold now just how i like it!;;;;
3031;this place;;;;
3032;we are staying at the legacy golf resort and that we would grab a quick bite there since we were driving by;;;;
3033;such a fun atmosphere !  and fantastic food that has a unique flare and is healthy;;;;
3034;i also like the casual environment where you can play outdoor games with the family;;;;
3035;highly recommend this spot!!!;;;;
3036;one of my favorite places to eat in town;;;;
3037;they have the best bean dip i've ever had;;;;
3038;the owner is so kind and i highly recommend a margarita on the rocks and chicken tacos;;;;
3039;first time ever coming here even though i live less than a mile away;;;;
3040;i have to admit it was fantastic! i ordered the surf & turf taco plate;;;;
3041;both of the tacos were full of flavor and tasted very fresh;;;;
3042;i got the spanish rice instead of beans and it was delicious not dry and over cooked like most places;;;;
3043;"the young man at the register ""chris"" was very helpful with ordering and extremely pleasant";;;;
3044;i will definitely be coming back to check out the $1;;;;
3045;50 tacos on tuesday;;;;
3046;so i once went to see brent spiner the guy who played data on star trek talk at a convention (i'm cool) and he opened his little talk by telling us all about how the night before he'd had a truly unique dining experience;;;;
3047;he went to burrito boyz;;;;
3048;his only regret?  not getting a large;;;;
3049;he's pretty much bang on;;;;
3050;there's very little to regret when it comes to burrito boyz;;;;
3051;their burritos are big and filled to the point of bursting with delicious flavours;;;;
3052;i usually go for the small because the large really is very large but i'll indulge once in a while;;;;
3053;they've got a variety of meats you can choose from;;;;
3054;some favourite being chicken halibut and beef;;;;
3055;everything is great really;;;;
3056;even their level of spice is always bang on for me;;;;
3057;you can request that they withhold certain things like hot sauce or jalopenos but trust me it's not that bad;;;;
3058;i went here for lunch and got the grilled cajun chicken sandwich and salad both of which were fine;;;;
3059;the service was really good;;;;
3060;overall not a bad place but nothing spectacular;;;;
3061;battista's hole in the wall is awesome! went here for the first time when i was in vegas for my kickball tourney (wakapalooza) early october;;;;
3062;my teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner saturday night;;;;
3063;it's located right next to the flamingo hotel where we were staying so we were able to walk over;;;;
3064;the restaurant is pretty big itself but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms;;;;
3065;the decor is awesome;;;;
3066;definitely a friendly local vibe;;;;
3067;since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us) we had to wait a bit before getting a table;;;;
3068;not a big deal since we started pre-drinking at the bar;;;;
3069;the price range for the meals depends but all range from $23-40;;;;
3070;you get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though plus all the meals come with minestrone soup or italian salad garlic bread pasta side & homemade cappuccino;;;;
3071;i ordered the lasagna and it was huge;;;;
3072;i probably ate a quarter of it before i got full;;;;
3073;i probably wouldn't have been as full if i hadn't filled up on garlic bread but i couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing;;;;
3074;the cappuccino was really good too! more of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest;;;;
3075;service was good;;;;
3076;they were kind enough to split our party in two to help make the check easier;;;;
3077;we even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! i would definitely come back again;;;;
3078;i am speechless;;;;
3079;i am without words to properly describe this place;;;;
3080;everything about this place is amazing;;;;
3081;the staff the food everything;;;;
3082;i ate one meal today and i made it count by getting the 2-meat plate with brisket and ribs with grits and beans as the sides;;;;
3083;the ribs had to be my favorite but my mind was blown by the jalapeã±o cheddar grits and then lord the brisket and beans;;;;
3084;oh hell who am i kidding i can't put these in any order;;;;
3085;eat everything here;;;;
3086;i don't know who bekke is but she's got one hell of a pecan pie named after her;;;;
3087;the best aged angus burger fed on carrots;;;;
3088;the staff is awesome too;;;;
3089;can't wait to go back;;;;
3090;5 stars;;;;
3091;an extra star for the legendary iraqi fish dish known as 'masgoof;;;;
3092;'  if you are a fan of fish dishes this is a must as this is a delectable technique used for thousands of years in iraq;;;;
3093;an entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste and is then placed in a 45-degree angle by a charcoal fire;;;;
3094;traditionally large freshwater fish are used but at chateau the fish of choice is tilapia - which is quite good and i suspect the best method to prepare this dish;;;;
3095;the result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable;;;;
3096;it is not very often that i get the pleasure of enjoying a nice masgoof;;;;
3097;in most cases i find kabob houses to be boring and that isn't because i don't love the almighty kabob it's because i have come to expect that kabob places outside of the middle east detroit and even western europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope it normally ends in disappointment for me - i should have never made that trip to iran in 2007 where i was in kabob paradise;;;;
3098;however chateau kabob located in the frankophilic metropolis of montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope;;;;
3099;here in washington dc we need to cling to places like shamshiri and alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there isn't a single kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor isn't particularly incumbent of them to reach for the stars;;;;
3100;chateau kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in iraq and iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of kabobs;;;;
3101;at chateau the spices are right the juiciness is on par and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent kabob;;;;
3102;and perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that chateau also got right is the rice!  it is superb here - fluffy velvety and aromatic;;;;
3103;the interiors and dã©cor of chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as i've come to expect that most other persian or arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man;;;;
3104;it appears that these guys were tasteful and enlisted the help of someone to actually design the space with thoughtful layout and pleasant finishes;;;;
3105;some aspiring middle eastern restauranteurs tend to think that they are the best interior designers on the planet - that is until they actual design their space;;;;
3106;i'm glad the guys at chateau hired a designer - that along with the fish the delicious kabob and good company makes chateau a pleasurable experience worth revisiting if you are ever in montreal and seriously have a hankering for kabobs;;;;
3107;hats off to the owner and chef who are always in the restaurant tending to guests - some of the nicest people you'll meet;;;;
3108;i have been going to this nail salon for 8 months now;;;;
3109;i only go to ahn - she is so great!  never once has she hurt me while cutting my cuticles;;;;
3110;i always get gel manicure & pedicure & she does a fantastic job!!   all tools are clean & sterilized and salon is pleasant  to be in;;;;
3111;too much food and not good for diabetics the food is delicious;;;;
3112;just had a spread of the waffle protein omelette veggie omelette brioche french toast and chicken and waffles between 6 of us;;;;
3113;oh left off apple pancakes;;;;
3114;all great and tracee was the best waitress;;;;
3115;she leads a great happy birthday too;;;;
3116;decent burgers here;;;;
3117;didn't live up to the hype though;;;;
3118;one thing that concerned me was the gal cooking the burgers had long hair that was not tied back;;;;
3119;just an fyi in case you're squeamish about plucking hair out of your food;;;;
3120;jodi the salesperson design of the layout of the cabinets was excellent;;;;
3121;jayson installed the cabinets professionally;;;;
3122;the staff and materials used high quality;;;;
3123;wow! so fresh ripe and sweet! and right in my back yard! i have watched customers go in and out of this small location in the strip mall and always wanted to try this! so glad i did! can't wait to come back and try everything else!;;;;
3124;i'm so;;;;
3125;heated;;;;
3126;i bought the 3 amigo and it was amazing;;;;
3127;i can't believe they'd serve me something this good;;;;
3128;i should have listened at the other reviews for this place;;;;
3129;i got the hopeful signature poke bowl and it was very bland and didn't quite sit right in my stomach;;;;
3130;maybe too much sauce? it is comparable to  having salmon sushi ingredients in a bowl with way too much rice;;;;
3131;it's too bad because i love poke bowls and had high hopes for this place;;;;
3132;2 stars for the nice interior;;;;
3133;if i could give this place 0 stars i would;;;;
3134;they are rude unprofessional and they have personal lockers that you have to put your purse in to shop with them;;;;
3135;i was asked to go and put my purse in my car;;;;
3136;excuse me?! is this even legal? are you going to replace my purse and it's contents if someone steals my personal items? i'm not sure who is running this place but this insane policy is clearly negatively impacting you business;;;;
3137;bad move bad business move;;;;
3138;go across the street to sally's;;;;
3139;one of my favorites for cheap fast and tasty mexican! it's definitely low-key and casual but for a scrumptious chimichanga with terrific queso and a heavy-on-the-tequila margarita this place has it all!;;;;
3140;amazing;;;;
3141;in phoenix for the #bmophx marathon;;;;
3142;feet felt like i had run 26;;;;
3143;2 miles alright this morning;;;;
3144;stopped by for a foot massage and these guys are amazing;;;;
3145;walked out of there feeling like i had two new feet!;;;;
3146;i have had foot massages all over the country and these guys are top two or three for sure!;;;;
3147;i have a confession to make;;;;
3148;i have an obsession with tongue;;;;
3149;that's right folks - tongue;;;;
3150;i love it;;;;
3151;name the animal - duck pig cow - it's definitely one of the best eating parts of the animal;;;;
3152;(what were thinking about something else? you guys have dirty minds;;;;
3153;p  !) being asian my parents indoctrined this love at a very early age;;;;
3154;when i discovered that jewish delis were into tongue too (and liver yum!) i pretty much loved hitting up inexpensive places to nosh;;;;
3155;i was kind of depressed in vegas because;;;;
3156;well on the strip you pass by all these famous delis that basically rape your wallet;;;;
3157;you can imagine how happy i was to find the bagel cafe!;;;;
3158;my hubby got the pastrami and i ordered the tongue sandwich;;;;
3159;perfection;;;;
3160;really;;;;
3161;and not hard on the wallet either which is the best part;;;;
3162;i did try a slice of boston creme cake and it is totally junky good;;;;
3163;fair pricing;;;;
3164;quick response;;;;
3165;great junk removal;;;;
3166;brandon gets it done;;;;
3167;quite possibly the worst meal i have had in ages;;;;
3168;the service was glacial;;;;
3169;i ordered a house salad but was told not all the ingredients listed on the menu were available;;;;
3170;i ended up with a plate of arugula and a tomato with some not-so-tasty french dressing  we waited for over an hour for the main course to arrive--general jackson's chicken;;;;
3171;the menu promises;;;;
3172;"""boneless marinated chicken deep fried and tossed in spicy savory sauce served with jasmine rice broccoli and napa""  spicey sauce?  this sauce was so spicy i was unable to even taste the chicken";;;;
3173;the rice was strictly uncle ben's and i saw no broccoli or napa;;;;
3174;we had a couple beers before the meal while waiting;;;;
3175;total bill;;;;
3176;$55;;;;
3177;i'm not a tightwad but dinner in a little strip mall restaurant should not set you back $55--or else it should be delectable;;;;
3178;"battiste and dupree was not the ""hidden gem"" others had told me about";;;;
3179;hope your mileage differs;;;;
3180;good clean place to get a mani/ pedi;;;;
3181;the two came to $39 with tax and they did a great job of both;;;;
3182;tvs all over so you can watch tv and freindly staff;;;;
3183;will be going back for my next mani/pedi;;;;
3184;**** update*****;;;;
3185;the great manicure that i got here lasted all the way through my vacation to mexico without  so much as a chip! this was a regular manicure and not done with shellac;;;;
3186;only now after two days back to work and polishing mad silverware is it starting to chip;;;;
3187;i'm upping the stars from my former 4 to 5;;;;
3188;very impressed and will be returning with friends;;;;
3189;interior is super cool and chill & the place has numerous decorative pieces if you look carefully;;;;
3190;i had harajuku and penicillin & they are amazing especially the penicillin;;;;
3191;the dash of islay really takes it to the next level;;;;
3192;all the bartender look very passionate & our main bartender joseph was amazing;;;;
3193;def worth stopping by;;;;
3194;great food and have good vegetarian options;;;;
3195;always busy  lots of great sauces to choose from;;;;
3196;first time buyer,;;;;
3197;i was excited to go in buy my first car the last week of november 2014;;;;
3198;at the beginning the owner was very nice and was giving all the details of the car i bought a mini cooper;;;;
3199;knowing that it had issues in the transmission;;;;
3200;witch he promised he would cover with and insurance asc warranty a vehicle protection plan within three months or 3000 miles;;;;
3201;i contacted him several times for him to get my car fixed he kept saying that he would fix it after the holidays;;;;
3202;january february passed the car was not fix yet;;;;
3203;i contacted him one las time i told him that i would give him one more month than he told me that he has been working on it still;;;;
3204;he told me that it was an imported part witch was not easy to find;;;;
3205;i told him i will take legal action and he than answered with '' do whatever you have to do'' with a arrogant tone so unprofessional till now i can say that he has never!!! contacted me!!! to keep me updated or give me a solution;;;;
3206;i believe i have been more than patient at this time it is incredible how they claim to be a legal business;;;;
3207;i will be contacting him again and demand a solution;;;;
3208;i highly suggest you think twice about going here;;;;
3209;i have read another review regarding several comparable issues;;;;
3210;i have never had this experience and it is horrible driving your first car with a bad transmission;;;;
3211;i really want to warn you do not go here!!!;;;;
3212;i have never written a review but i really want let people know that these people are committing fraud!!!;;;;
3213;be aware of this location!;;;;
3214;i was very disappointed with the customer service from the server to the owner which really surprised me what a bitch!  i ordered a western omelet with hash browns crispy and when i got the omelet there was no cheese in it;;;;
3215;the hash browns were barely cooked;;;;
3216;"in addition we wanted coffee refills and no one ever came back to ask us!!  when i inquired about the no cheese the server told me no it doesn't come with it and when i asked the owner she said that that isn't the correct way western omelets traditionally  are served! she argued with me about the history of the western omelet instead she should have been more focused on her customers being happy especially since we i told her it was our first time there and we were excited to try her food quite honestly i don't look for a class lesson when i go out to eat i just want good food and good customer service i got neither today!  the correct thing for the server and the half wit owner would have been to say "" sorry sir but i would be happy to redo your omelet with cheese and make u another order of hash browns and make sure they are crispy""";;;;
3217;but guess what none of that happened!  i have cooked in restaurant my whole life and i have never heard of any omelet not coming with some type of cheese and even if she was correct in her history she definitely failed me at her customer service skills;;;;
3218;in addition when paying for my food i was told that they only take cash so i had to go out and get cash to pay for this horrible experience and that didn't sit well with me i almost said screwed it but my conscience said don't do it so i went back and paid my bill;;;;
3219;long story short if you want good customer service and u want good food i would recommend going to denny's or bob evans;;;;
3220;oh yeah one more thing if no stars were a choice i would have put none!!!;;;;
3221;let's just say i'm shocked;;;;
3222;people are super friendly;;;;
3223;have other food then donuts! it close to my work;;;;
3224;price isn't too bad it is reasonable;;;;
3225;it's a great place to relax and get some work done;;;;
3226;i really enjoyed ashley and ami salon;;;;
3227;she did a great job was friendly and professional;;;;
3228;i usually get my hair done when i go to mi because of the quality of the highlights and the price;;;;
3229;the price was very affordable and the highlights;;;;
3230;fantastic!;;;;
3231;thanks ashley;;;;
3232;i highly recommend you and ill be back;;;;
3233;brandy was amazing! loved her personality and that she made all of us feel welcome at the studio! she is a great technician to boot! highly recommend seeing this place if you're interested in great photos of your baby!;;;;
3234;i have been to vintner grill twice in two weeks recently;;;;
3235;the first was on administrative professionals' day for lunch;;;;
3236;it was packed and the food was delicious;;;;
3237;as is the usual with vintner the service was not great;;;;
3238;our waiter was friendly (when we saw him) but he just couldn't keep up in his section;;;;
3239;hubby and i also went back on a friday at 2;;;;
3240;15 for a liquor lunch and i must say it was one of the best dining experiences we have had in las vegas;;;;
3241;the food was excellent as it has always been;;;;
3242;however for the first time the service (by mark) was impeccable;;;;
3243;was it because there were only a few tables?  possibly but something tells me that i have found my go-to server from now on;;;;
3244;he made great recommendations and the timing of everything was amazing;;;;
3245;sitting outside and enjoying champagne was heavenly;;;;
3246;please go to vintner grill;;;;
3247;it is worth the drive from the strip;;;;
3248;just be patient in case the service is a little slow;;;;
3249;besides you never know what celebrity you may see!;;;;
3250;whoa!;;;;
3251;red carpet handles business;;;;
3252;no wait no lines no hassle  seriously though;;;;
3253;why worry about lines in vegas when you can pregame in the room and immediately step into the club?!?!;;;;
3254;i'd give them a million stars;;;;
3255;walked into xs -no problem-       9 dudes;;;;
3256;walked into ebc- no problem-    9 dudes;;;;
3257;crazy huge 30 passenger limo- gmc kodiak or something-   ridiculous;;;;
3258;couldn't have made my bachelor party better;;;;
3259;i will be using them again and again for as long as i live when i come to vegas;;;;
3260;all their staff is great with email or phone correspondence thank you annie!!;;;;
3261;you cannot go wrong with them;;;;
3262;shell out the extra dough and book your vegas clubbing experience you wont be disappointed;;;;
3263;i've never been to akina for their ayce dinners only for their wonderfully priced bento box set lunches;;;;
3264;their bento boxes are all set at $5;;;;
3265;they come with miso soup salad and 3 cali-rolls;;;;
3266;the boxes themselves are large and usually have like 3-4 different things in them (i;;;;
3267;tofu mixed veg main course rice);;;;
3268;value wise this has got to be one of the best lunches you can get for $5;;;;
3269;these guys literally saved me;;;;
3270;i had a rfp due during the holidays;;;;
3271;with my computer and printer crashing i was in a serious bind;;;;
3272;i usually go to staples printing centers-- but they couldn't get it done in time;;;;
3273;so i got on the peoria chamber website and international minute press/desert sky printing came to the rescue;;;;
3274;they finished my printing and the rfp was turned in with 1 hour to spare;;;;
3275;i recommend them highly!;;;;
3276;great-tasting deep dish pizzas;;;;
3277;they make a mean calzone as well;;;;
3278;i'm a little sad that they don't use fresh mushrooms;;;;
3279;i am never disappointed with this place;;;;
3280;i've yet to eat at the restaurant but the ahi bar is amazing! i always come in to get the spicy ahi bowl and a few sides of ahi;;;;
3281;so yummy!;;;;
3282;a must go destination in phoenix;;;;
3283;chinese - mexican - jamaican fusion fast casual (or as i like to call it - confusion!);;;;
3284;it's a phoenix original;;;;
3285;it's been on diner's dives and drive ins;;;;
3286;if it's your first time go up to the counter (to the left of the cash registers) and ask for the orientation - they'll walk you through the ordering process and give you samples of several of the dishes;;;;
3287;after you do that grab an order form and pick a 2 item combo and choose 7 9 black and white;;;;
3288;that's all your really need to know;;;;
3289;-)  that's jade red chicken jerk chicken black beans and white rice;;;;
3290;jade red chicken is sort of their take on sweet and sour but with a spicy twist;;;;
3291;jerk chicken is jamaican influenced (and can be quite spicy some days);;;;
3292;the black beans are amazing - stir them into your rice (easier to eat both with your chopsticks when you do this);;;;
3293;and did i mention you get a snickerdoodle with your order?  yep!  best snickerdoodles around and one comes with every dish!;;;;
3294;if you haven't been to chino's - it's time - make a run for the border/great wall/beach!;;;;
3295;(and make sure to read the non-pc t-shirts while you wait - funny!);;;;
3296;i think when the first people i encountered was courteous and friendly then the critic inside of me melts a little the front desk was very helpful and friendly the therapies were excellent;;;;
3297;i even decided to join their wellness program because it's very accommodating and manageable for my expenses;;;;
3298;terry (the owner) has been fixing my car for years and has done consistently great work;;;;
3299;i completely trust his opinion when he tells me what he thinks is wrong or what the course of action should be;;;;
3300;i have seen many of his projects over the years in many different stages of completion and they always look and run superbly;;;;
3301;the shop itself is always full of cars from all different decades in for all different types of work and the reception area is all made up in a tiki-type theme so when you visit you will definitely have something cool to look at while you wait;;;;
3302;i would recommend this shop to anyone with an old car that needs fixing whether that means getting an oil change or having major restoration work done;;;;
3303;this is one of my favorite places to eat;;;;
3304;the food is delicious fresh and almost everything can be made with tofu as a substitute;;;;
3305;the owners are very friendly and the food truly is superb!;;;;
3306;we were recommended this vet by a friend who has gone to him for years;;;;
3307;and we are not disappointed;;;;
3308;doctor youssef first helped my boyfriend when his cat had a horrible hairball stuck in her stomach;;;;
3309;he shows so much compassion and understanding for animals it is hard not to believe he truly cares for their well being;;;;
3310;he is not afraid to tell you if you are harming your pet;;;;
3311;if they are overweight he will tell you straight up and let you know you are causing them harm;;;;
3312;if you are an uptight suburbian then don't go to him;;;;
3313;he will tell you that you are killing your dog feeding them 'puppocinos';;;;
3314;which you are;;;;
3315;i started taking my dog here after she expressed her hatred of her previous vet who felt that it was 'no big deal' and that they could always just muzzle her or sedate her for check ups;;;;
3316;i felt that was ridiculous and brought her to doctor youssef who felt the same and is doing everything in his power to make her comfortable with him and his staff;;;;
3317;he has even let me take her around the whole building just to get use to it;;;;
3318;his prices are very fair and he himself is the most trustworthy vet i have yet to meet;;;;
3319;one conversation with him and you can tell he does not care about money he is truly one of the very few who are in this business just because they care about animals;;;;
3320;i love this guy so much i recommended him to my best friend when she got her cat and she takes it to him as well;;;;
3321;she got the cat spayed and he offered to keep it overnight for free!;;;;
3322;it is a drive away for me but is well worth it;;;;
3323;i would drive to boulder city if i had to just to keep this guy as my vet;;;;
3324;we were here on a saturday afternoon for lunch;;;;
3325;we had a party of 6;;;;
3326;the server was great;;;;
3327;she was on top of filling drinks and making sure to bring out any extras we had asked for with our meals;;;;
3328;i had the turkey chipotle club wrap;;;;
3329;it was ok;;;;
3330;nothing special but not bad;;;;
3331;the fries are so good! my husband had the open face meatloaf and was really disappointed;;;;
3332;he didn't even eat half!;;;;
3333;went for saturday brunch;;;;
3334;wait was doable compare to other buffets;;;;
3335;we paid about $38/person which was standard for vegas buffet;;;;
3336;however everything was underwhelming nothing really stood out from their selection;;;;
3337;for the price and to pay just a little extra i'd recommend wicked spoon or bachannal;;;;
3338;pita jungle is one of our family's favorite places to go for a quick fresh healthy meal;;;;
3339;the kids love the chipotle chicken flatbread and i am addicted to the moroccan gazpacho! we feel great when we leave and usually try make better food choices for the rest of the day!;;;;
3340;i've been a happy client for several years! ashlee takes time and ultimate care to do an outstanding job every time;;;;
3341;i receive tons of compliments on my lashes and how natural they look;;;;
3342;ashley is a true lash artist;;;;
3343;i'm 100% satisfied every time!;;;;
3344;i love their chicken street tacos!!!  btw this rubio is inside the monte carlo ( mgm resorts employees like aria,vdara,luxor,mirage etc;;;;
3345;) gets 15% off just show your employees i;;;;
3346;i went here  they were about to close but the cashier was especially helpful;;;;
3347;but i guess they were tired of work;;;;
3348;brandi is awesome;;;;
3349;love her demeanor and personality;;;;
3350;she is an excellent stylist;;;;
3351;i am also a cosmetologist so i know  the real deal when i see one! i will be back again for sure! her scalp message was perfection;;;;
3352;"so relaxing and i had a blast talking ""shop"" with her";;;;
3353;highly recommend this lady!;;;;
3354;chad installed a new heavy door for me which required modification and specialized hardware;;;;
3355;his work was excellent and precise and completed sooner than expected;;;;
3356;he was very polite knowledgeable and trustworthy;;;;
3357;i will definitely offer all my future work to him and have already recommended him to my friends;;;;
3358;to start its a beautiful venue;;;;
3359;definitely a hidden gem in the gta;;;;
3360;but please be very very careful and get everything in writing;;;;
3361;george christakis the co-owner of this venue and manager of crystal fountain is very devious and sketchy;;;;
3362;we had checked out a few venues one being crystal fountain where we met george;;;;
3363;he was definitely rude and lacked professionalism;;;;
3364;we left with a very bad impression;;;;
3365;fast forward a few week and we spotted estate banquet we emailed and arranged to meet up;;;;
3366;we showed up and the one we had the appointment with was no where to be seen having passed our meeting off to someone else without informing us;;;;
3367;the venue is beautiful an price was in our budget and we wanted to proceed once we could work out the food details;;;;
3368;my girlfriend did not like the unprofessional manner of george whom i later found out when i asked is indeed the same george from crystal fountain;;;;
3369;we called george the next day to discuss food options and he said yes everything we wanted we could have for the price we discussed;;;;
3370;tasting was included for 6 people;;;;
3371;i asked him to send me an email confirming what we spoke about on the phone;;;;
3372;"when the email arrived it simply had generics such as ""assorted veggies assorted cakes hors d'oeuvres"" as well as a tasting for 2 people";;;;
3373;as well he upped the amount of people we had to guarantee for the price;;;;
3374;when we called back to discuss he verbally told us again what it would include but when i asked him to email us specifics he refused;;;;
3375;in a very arrogant tone he informed us that he was an expert in his field and he does not give specifics;;;;
3376;that grilled veggies will be based on what he can buy for that price when the wedding arrives almost a year later;;;;
3377;that it's his discretion what desserts and pastries he would provide;;;;
3378;needless to say i told him unless we could establish a written contract outlining what he would be providing for the price we were paying we would be walking away;;;;
3379;he said no way is he going to put anything details down in writing and that we were to trust him;;;;
3380;we walked;;;;
3381;please be very wary of this george he is very unscrupulous;;;;
3382;the venue itself it nice and private but no way was i going to ruin such a special day by getting involved with such shady business dealings;;;;
3383;i bought a house that had a safe with a dial;;;;
3384;type lock which while definitely secure is a bit slow to open and makes me want to use the safe less often;;;;
3385;i did have a business card from the safe keeper attached to opening instructions that was left by the seller;;;;
3386;i went online found their website and emailed them regarding changing to an electronic lock;;;;
3387;they replied in the affirmative the next morning;;;;
3388;i called and scheduled the work which was done within two days of my first contact;;;;
3389;the service technician vid was on time knowledgeable very personable and completed the changeover in the timeframe he had quoted even while explaining everything about the safe the locking mechanism and answering all my questions;;;;
3390;this was a great experience with a top notch company;;;;
3391;i couldn't be more pleased;;;;
3392;i'm not sure what's happened to futo buta but the past couple times we've come it just hasn't been the same;;;;
3393;we've received dirty utensils and the ramen just isn't as good;;;;
3394;recently took some family over and the food was bland and overly fatty;;;;
3395;i really do hope that it gets back on track because this was one of my favorite restaurants in charlotte!;;;;
3396;believe the negative reviews;;;;
3397;i came here after a round of golf in order to have dinner and a few brews;;;;
3398;the service wasn't terrible it was non-existent;;;;
3399;the waiter seemed to take an eternity to take our order;;;;
3400;i ordered the penne with italian sausage only to find out they were out of sausage;;;;
3401;the waiter suggested an alternative;;;;
3402;i went ahead and ordered it;;;;
3403;what i ended up with was penne with canned tomato sauce and what i swear was frozen meatballs;;;;
3404;at $12;;;;
3405;what a shame;;;;
3406;as i'm done with my food and beer i wasn't asked if i wanted anything else my check was just dropped off;;;;
3407;service and food were bad i will never return;;;;
3408;love this pub;;;;
3409;the food is not great but if you stick to the pub grub faves;;;;
3410;you should be fine;;;;
3411;the best part about this place is the staff! all the girls that work here are amazing!;;;;
3412;very simple  yet very tasty wraps;;;;
3413;corn chowder soup was ok but the ravi soup was great with lots of authentic indian spices;;;;
3414;we love johnny rockets;;;;
3415;i am not sure what goes on at this location-or if it was just an off day-but the chicken sandwich was inedible;;;;
3416;it tasted like nuked chicken;;;;
3417;the shakes were the normal quality-great shakes;;;;
3418;servers were very kind-would have been a one star but not for these two positives;;;;
3419;our recommendation is to pass on this location;;;;
3420;not a fair example of a typical johnny rockets quality;;;;
3421;i had a engine in warranty from lkq these guys were to install its replacement;;;;
3422;they told me done in a few days ok;;;;
3423;i went there and noticed when the engine was taken out they carelessly left my ac dangling and did not remove it to install new engine;;;;
3424;no big deal till you understand the rest;;;;
3425;this is a cheap way to not refill system and do it right;;;;
3426;after going to get my car when they said it was done i notice ac didn't work and wrong coolant added to radiator;;;;
3427;( cannot use regular green;;;;
3428;yellow ford required ) then i say i will come get it when they fix the ac they tell me hours later its the pcm;;;;
3429;( computer ) well ok you guys shorted it out the only thing wrong was a valve rattle now this?? after 2 days with lkq saying they are going to send a inspector i drove past and noticed my mirrors loose (broken ) on both sides!! i am anal when it comes to my car i bought new in 2007;;;;
3430;this was enough i took it home;;;;
3431;i had enough;;;;
3432;they forgot 4 bolts 2 in wrong spot one digging into power steering rack power steering bottle cracked on bottom from a poor removal and hid the fact it was cracked on the lower nipple and the ac system they claimed did not hold r-134a because they did remove the ac later and lost the o-rings when they filled it it leaked;;;;
3433;and they shorted the ac protective diode;;;;
3434;it was not the pcm;;;;
3435;this place might be good for a oil change if you tell them how to do it but that's all;;;;
3436;telling me how do we know you didn't bring it in here like this;;;;
3437;bahahaha a back yard weekend mechanic was able to figure out they were unskilled for the task;;;;
3438;i will make sure with a huge online review on every review site that this place is not the place to take a car;;;;
3439;or a peddle bike for that matter;;;;
3440;i replaced the o-rings pulled the diode and got the ac working after i vacuumed it and refilled what armatures;;;;
3441;i guess i got to go to ford spend $80 on a new power steering bottle and tell lkq to send me the money;;;;
3442;when they first got my car knowing it was under warranty from lkq they tried to get me to pay them the other $45 per hour on top of the $55 an hour they were getting under warranty;;;;
3443;i told them do not touch it until i contact lkq they tried to scam me out of $45 an hour x12 hours;;;;
3444;i am not stupid;;;;
3445;lkq should have pulled it out right there and then but no;;;;
3446;they agreed to do it for the $55 an hour but the skill these guys have isn't worth minimum wage;;;;
3447;place was okay;;;;
3448;sangria i has was watery & unflavorful but got me buzzed;;;;
3449;that was part of the point of the drink but i like a craftily concocted cocktail or elixir & this one was not;;;;
3450;but (i'm using a lot of buts;;;;
3451;) the unchicken & waffles was quite okay;;;;
3452;they used veggie meat & they did quite a good job making it like chicken;;;;
3453;since i can't do roscoe's cause i'm a veggie this spot did the trick;;;;
3454;if roscoe's was in europe it would be a different story;;;;
3455;it hit the spot;;;;
3456;came with sweet potato mash and collard greens on the side;;;;
3457;it was all super healthy;;;;
3458;no crazy amounts of butter or oil;;;;
3459;yet it tasted amazing;;;;
3460;but it definitely could have used a side of syrup;;;;
3461;what was on there wasn't nearly sufficient enough;;;;
3462;the atmosphere was not to my liking;;;;
3463;very cafe-like and crowded;;;;
3464;but it's an alright spot;;;;
3465;i may or may not go back;;;;
3466;cannot praise this place enough!!  if there were 10 stars i'd give them a 10 star rating;;;;
3467;i called them about some custom lighting i needed for my handicap van and they scheduled an appointment for me to come in and see jay for advisement;;;;
3468;the service was impeccable the pricing was reasonable and they were honest;;;;
3469;i plan to go back for some other custom work and will be letting everyone i know what a great place this is to deal with;;;;
3470;it's a nice relief when you find a great business when there are so many questionable businesses these days;;;;
3471;highly recommend!!;;;;
3472;i placed a large takeout order (almost $100) late on a thursday night and the gentleman made me repeat every part of the order at least twice;;;;
3473;he didn't even bother to tell me what time the order would be ready;;;;
3474;i frequent this place for lunch and use them for work events pretty frequently and have always had a decent experience but not this time;;;;
3475;when i got home and went to unpack the food i realized the order was completely wrong;;;;
3476;checked the receipt and the order that was rung in was completely different then what i asked for and with totally different quantities;;;;
3477;it was as if the order was erased and the guy just tried to make it up out of memory;;;;
3478;certainly was not please to have ordered mainly calzones and end up with almost all subs;;;;
3479;the most annoying part of the experience is the sausage pepper and onion subs were 85% peppers and onions;;;;
3480;there was about 10 slices of very very thin sausage on the entire sandwhich which i think is a ripoff for $8;;;;
3481;terrible experience overall and will highly make me reconsider ever going here again;;;;
3482;authentic and rustic full of ambiance;;;;
3483;great for families aswell as romantic dinners;;;;
3484;ahhh the memories;;;;
3485;reclining chairs with arm rests that rise are very comfortable;;;;
3486;movie prices are rising more and more;;;;
3487;new to calgary we did our homework on line and settled for capo for one of our first meals out;;;;
3488;did not disappoint! a 9 table restaurant intimate contemporary but not stuffy decor washrooms spotless service friendly and on point;;;;
3489;they truly want your dining experience to be a cut above the rest;;;;
3490;they are attentive without being intrusive and the food;;;;
3491;the gnocchi was suggested to us by a guest seated nearby who heard we were new to town;;;;
3492;this selection was wonderful pillowy dumpling puffs with lobster and truffle oil;;;;
3493;i was sold! my husband and i shared this plate of deliciousness and the restaurant will split the plate for you in the kitchen no problem;;;;
3494;the fresh bread came with shallot butter - wow a must try i love flavoured butters! for the main meal trio i got the dock side which is a perfect scallop perfect shrimp and the most tender buttery fish filet once can ask for;;;;
3495;"my husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as ""butter"" and loved everything else that accompanied it";;;;
3496;the small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! the sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive;;;;
3497;we each had one glass a red and white;;;;
3498;mmmmm! everything here is 100% italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! the chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us the perfect plates!;;;;
3499;the end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate;;;;
3500;the best choice we could of made - or was it?! we will have to find out next time we come! we enjoyed the location of capo in inglewood quite central and the waiter who called a taxi for us even waited with us outside chatting with us until the cab came;;;;
3501;what a gem of an eatery if you can afford to splurge now and then! a highlight of my week and would recommend to anyone!;;;;
3502;never had belizean food or have heard of them and they're right in front of my building for 7 months;;;;
3503;finally made my way over there and it's so dang good! chicken fell off the bone;;;;
3504;i ordered tamales since it's the special right now and it's huge for $5;;;;
3505;50! why did i wait so long! i was skeptical at first didn't know what to expect;;;;
3506;owners are super nice;;;;
3507;fajitas on fire;;;;
3508;5 beers in a bucket for $15;;;;
3509;good chips and salsa;;;;
3510;mariachi band;;;;
3511;strategic tv's for all seats;;;;
3512;excellent margaritas;;;;
3513;kid friendly;;;;
3514;this place rocks!!!;;;;
3515;out of all the places in las vegas to pick for cinco de mayo food drinks and music we picked this one based on yelp reviews;;;;
3516;we were first time visitors;;;;
3517;we will definitely return very soon!;;;;
3518;we arrived early to avoid long waits and drunk people;;;;
3519;by the time we left we might have been the very people we were trying to avoid!  drinks aside we enjoyed the flaming fajitas!  we ordered the fajitas for 2 with steak and shrimp;;;;
3520;it is more than enough for 2 people;;;;
3521;my hubs and i made 7 fajitas from the meat;;;;
3522;we can't speak to any of the other food;;;;
3523;oh wait!  now i remember we had an amazing desert;;;;
3524;a sopapilla topped with ice cream and strawberries;;;;
3525;it was delish!!;;;;
3526;we met juan the owner who welcomed us and our little toddler;;;;
3527;juan said he built the place to accomodate families and that their daily happy hours are restaurant-wide - and not exclusive to the bar only like many places in town;;;;
3528;their daily happy hour from 3-7pm looked really good!   our server was very friendly and the service was great!;;;;
3529;the mariachi band was an added bonus - we would love to return to hear them again;;;;
3530;they were very good!;;;;
3531;this is a place worth visiting!  good food good drinks good prices and good service!  locally owned;;;;
3532;flaming fajitas - what more can you ask for!!!;;;;
3533;drive-thru style smog station conveniently located close to the dmv;;;;
3534;i had a bit of trouble finding it via google maps- it's behind the 7-11 across the street from smith's;;;;
3535;super quick service i was done in about 5 minutes;;;;
3536;10/10 would recommend;;;;
3537;over priced nasty nachos;;;;
3538;the meat was so salty i couldn't eat them;;;;
3539;and they tried to sell me a regular bottled water for $7;;;;
3540;i will never go to this place again!!! this place sucks!!;;;;
3541;after a day of shopping at the local mall and with dinner still hours off a friend and i popped into grazie (based on a recommendation from a former phoenix resident) for a snack;;;;
3542;didn't hurt that my hotel was just up the street;;;;
3543;after a quick review of the menu pizza seemed the best option and settled on the capricciosa (tomato sauce mozzarella artichokes olives mushrooms salame ham parmigiano reggian);;;;
3544;the pie emerged from the wood fire oven piping hot with a slightly burnt crust;;;;
3545;it lasted approximately 5 minutes before vanishing into our hungry bellies;;;;
3546;wine list is all-italian and well priced with many by the glass selections;;;;
3547;i opted for a nice barbera which was poured generously into a large glass;;;;
3548;i'd be a regular if living in the area;;;;
3549;was amazing the first visit (when corporate was still overseeing their operations during the first few weeks of opening);;;;
3550;the second visit was horrible;;;;
3551;we won't be returning;;;;
3552;the salads were watery and tasteless the fries were old burnt and overseasoned the restaurant was dirty and the tables sticky and the staff was impatient and unprofessional;;;;
3553;came in with my girl at 8;;;;
3554;05 on tuesday store closes at 9pm screen cracked on iphone6+ phone works great just a little fuzzy on front camera;;;;
3555;"she has apple care insurance plan 7 ""apple professionals"" there 3 helping customers 4 standing around";;;;
3556;"approached one saying she would like a new phone ""professional"" said there's no need for a new phone just a new screen unfortunately you don't have an appointment and there is no appointments available until friday  so we can set something up for you then";;;;
3557;"so we thought to ourselves what about the other 4 ""professionals"" doing? so my girl said i just want a new phone";;;;
3558;"the ""professional"" said well if the screen is just cracked there is no need for a new phone so we can make that appointment for friday";;;;
3559;at this point one guy did say that he wasn't doing anything and could do it but we just wanted a new phone;;;;
3560;so we had to be a bit rude and insist several times that we just wanted a new phone because we wanted it now;;;;
3561;finally they relented and got the phone and our the door at 8;;;;
3562;a little to uppity attitude;;;;
3563;unfortunately i don't understand the negative reviews maybe it was bad timing? but i loved the crazy burger;;;;
3564;i brought my american friend and he had the green burger and was impressed about how good it was;;;;
3565;super friendly staff they made sure i had every condiment (ketchup napkins etc;;;;
3566;) i didn't expect any service at all from a burger joint but it was an pleasant addition;;;;
3567;i'll be coming back for the food and the exceptional service;;;;
3568;i've never had such a nice experience at a burger joint before;;;;
3569;i'd recommend the crazy burger combo (onion rings and boylan's black cherry soda);;;;
3570;although it was a bit messy it was delicious and i loved every single bite of it;;;;
3571;i'll definitely be coming back soon;;;;
3572;listen people this is the spot;;;;
3573;stop paying too much at over priced place where the portions are small and mash potatoes are green;;;;
3574;this place portion size it meant to feed a horse not a mouse like the other places;;;;
3575;like i'm coming back here over and over again;;;;
3576;plus my gf lives not far is its convenient;;;;
3577;had a fantastic experience dining at olive & ivy! believe it or not we even thoroughly enjoyed dining outside in the august scottsdale swelter- their misting system works amazingly well;;;;
3578;went with my daughter and two of her friends- and i totally loved this place! i liked the high ceilings the cozy decor the lighting and the marketplace feel of the interior;;;;
3579;because of numerous raves on yelp we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer;;;;
3580;it's true they are totally fabulous- not to be missed!;;;;
3581;i had chicken scaloppini which was delicious- perfectly prepared and served with just the right amount of sauce and mediterranean olives;;;;
3582;the girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about and then subsequently demolished them;;;;
3583;there wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate!;;;;
3584;the focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful and they have a great wine list here;;;;
3585;i had a glass of syrah from washington state which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced;;;;
3586;"we were celebrating one of my daughter's friend's birthdays so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an ""ice cream bar,"" which had ice cream marshmallow and lots of rich luscious chocolate";;;;
3587;it was totally delicious and reminded us of a s'more;;;;
3588;olive & ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in europe;;;;
3589;i will definitely be back- only wish we had an olive & ivy in tucson!;;;;
3590;i really like this bookstore for its dvd and music selections;;;;
3591;there's a nice clearance section with top end dvds going for only two dollars;;;;
3592;the staff here is very pleasant and it's clean and well organized;;;;
3593;i can't speak for their book section as i have yet to shop for books here;;;;
3594;they also have gadgets which is nice;;;;
3595;it's easy to find parking outside;;;;
3596;my one complaint if any would be that they apparently don't check for the regions of their dvds;;;;
3597;i've purchased several which weren't made for the us region so it was a total waste of money;;;;
3598;overall i really like shopping here and i'd recommend it to anyone who asked;;;;
3599;third time i have had my eyelashes done good service awesome staff reasonable prices;;;;
3600;highly recommend!;;;;
3601;terrible customer service  overprice  only one mechanic at the shop  3 weeks to fix my bike;;;;
3602;owner dale kieffer so rude i never come back again;;;;
3603;yamaha dealer same price excellent service;;;;
3604;this is a tricky one;;;;
3605;ab is a really cool looking spot really nice decor and ambiance comfy booths it even smells like a new car;;;;
3606;my group was greeted promptly by smiling hosts and seated in a nice booth;;;;
3607;drink orders were placed and when our margaritas arrived they were really really off and tasted terrible;;;;
3608;even after stirring and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough and didn't taste good;;;;
3609;our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff;;;;
3610;my replacement drink was a polish fizz and it was perfect;;;;
3611;highly recommended;;;;
3612;for an app we went with the pretzel fondue thanks to yelpers who recommended it;;;;
3613;as advertised it was delicious and i recommend it;;;;
3614;for lunch i had the fish and chips and my friend had some salad;;;;
3615;the fish and chips were very tasty but the price point for the portion i got- just didn't compute;;;;
3616;three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw;;;;
3617;again the food was good but you definitely don't get what you pay for;;;;
3618;i understand the concept of smaller portions euro style etc;;;;
3619;but for a bar food staple? i wasn't looking for a costco serving of anything but either bump up portion size or drop the price from $16 to $11;;;;
3620;i really liked our server but for some reason as things went on he was more and more absent;;;;
3621;to be fair we had a really difficult person that joined us some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out so i feel his pain;;;;
3622;anyway ab is a very attractive spot that might be great for drinks and app;;;;
3623;but for this price point i would hit durant's hillstone or beckett's table;;;;
3624;it's nice to leave a spot feeling that you got your monies worth and that just doesn't happen here;;;;
3625;ping pang pong has always been an outstanding choice in terms of chinese food here in the valley;;;;
3626;what is so surprising is that most chinese restaurants inside the hotels & casinos really are sub-par;;;;
3627;the very basic essence of clean fresh and friendly is the definition here and the food is quite authentic;;;;
3628;the servers work quite hard and there is a decent presence of managenent staff to ensure smooth operations;;;;
3629;the xo sauce is very tasty but be careful if you order it on the side as they will charge you for it (not exactly cheap);;;;
3630;still i have been quite pleased with the food & service upon every visit for a number of years now;;;;
3631;definitely recommend -;;;;
3632;wish i could give this place 0 stars;;;;
3633;we have had issues here before with being seated (it took them 15 minutes when the place was empty one time) but tonight takes the cake;;;;
3634;we went to get food at 2am pulled into the drive thru at 2;;;;
3635;we waited there for 15 minutes then we got trapped in the drive thru by a curb and other vehicles for 25 more minutes;;;;
3636;i got incredibly fed up and walked inside;;;;
3637;there were 2 tables seated - and they were already eating;;;;
3638;one woman was ordering at the counter when i went in;;;;
3639;i asked the worker at the counter if they shut down the drive thru and if they could inform the people waiting at the speaker because we were stuck and just wanted to leave;;;;
3640;"all he said is ""i don't know if they shut down the drive thru but i can take your order here";;;;
3641;""" like that doesnt help us";;;;
3642;we are still stuck in your crappy little drive thru and we don't even want to order here anymore;;;;
3643;he said he would meet me outside - which he didnt by the way but the line started to move so we said whatever and decided to still order because we had already waited 40 minutes;;;;
3644;"after they got the person in front of us through the drive thru they then told us to hold on a minutes because they are ""backed up inside"" but they weren't at all";;;;
3645;the parking lot had 2 cars and 3 people behind us in line and when i was inside a server was sitting at a table texting;;;;
3646;so don't tell me you are busy if your staff is getting paid for nothing;;;;
3647;"i yelled ""are you getting paid for this?"" through the speaker and he had time to answer and tell me to calm down but couldn't take my damn order";;;;
3648;we finally left with out even placing an order after 49 minutes;;;;
3649;will not return and by the other reviews for this place i should have checked yelp before ever coming here in the first place;;;;
3650;went to the mentor one after and got served right away;;;;
3651;decided on valley ent because my insurance provider covered them and they were conveniently located;;;;
3652;i needed a quick appointment and didn't want to wait several weeks;;;;
3653;i took a gamble and picked first available which was dr;;;;
3654;chuang;;;;
3655;after i made my appointment i began reading reviews on valley ent and dr;;;;
3656;chuang;;;;
3657;i couldn't have disagreed more on the negative reviews;;;;
3658;both valley ent and dr;;;;
3659;chuang were professional courteous thorough and friendly;;;;
3660;i will enthusiastically recommend both to anyone looking for quality healthcare;;;;
3661;i strongly endorse them;;;;
3662;they were excellent;;;;
3663;not the best pizza but not the worst and it's only $7;;;;
3664;i've only had the pepperoni but they have plenty of variety;;;;
3665;the guy behind the counter was super friendly;;;;
3666;remember- cash only!;;;;
3667;i have actually visited the village seafood buffet at the rio three times;;;;
3668;each time i have enjoyed myself;;;;
3669;i was torn on whether to give this 3 or 4 stars;;;;
3670;the reasons i chose 3 is because when i want a plethora of seafood i know i can come here and have good eats but it is on the expensive side;;;;
3671;the options are always solid and depending on the visit the choices can vary just a bit;;;;
3672;expect to wait in line for a bit and come with a very empty belly;;;;
3673;you will want to get the most for your money;;;;
3674;i didn't listen to the low reviews i wish i did;;;;
3675;literally the worst;;;;
3676;we went through two of their routers that both broke;;;;
3677;one didn't get us anywhere near the speed we were paying for i called and chatted with multiple people before we could get a replacement router;;;;
3678;finally got the replacement and things seemed okay but no it completely broke in less than a month;;;;
3679;it won't even turn on anymore;;;;
3680;they suggested we go buy a new router from best buy who btw doesn't sell dsl routers anymore wtf!? they charge you ridiculous shipping prices for the replacement for their item that doesn't work properly! every time you chat with them you get different answers and they transfer you to about 10 people before they even get close to answering your question;;;;
3681;do not use this service it might be cheaper but not cheap enough to deal with all this bs they put you though;;;;
3682;great food and prices;;;;
3683;servings are generous and the atmosphere is good;;;;
3684;a nice place for traditional mexican in old town;;;;
3685;really liked the pollo relleno;;;;
3686;below average food;;;;
3687;the service can be spotty depending on the time of day;;;;
3688;just;;;;
3689;look elsehwere;;;;
3690;i'm surprised they are still in business;;;;
3691;paco's tacos is the real deal! in spite of the great yelp reviews i still had my reservations about eating at another texmex chain;;;;
3692;how good could it be i thought? well they totally nailed it from the complementary chips and dip to the sauce stains on my napkin!;;;;
3693;the dining area was empty and only a few people were at the bar upon my arrival for a late lunch;;;;
3694;adlai our server was very helpful with recommendations and was knowledgeable of the menu;;;;
3695;i had a overstuffed grilled chicken taco which arrived with mexican rice mixed cabbage coleslaw and their own charro style pintos all at the incredible price of;;;;
3696;drum roll please;;;;
3697;7 bucks! my buddy tried paco's taco which is shredded beef and was equally as tasty;;;;
3698;servings are huge and everything was fantastic;;;;
3699;premeal chips and salsa were delivered to the table immediately;;;;
3700;the chips are very thin and were very fresh;;;;
3701;the place was clean and attractive;;;;
3702;sanitation rating was a 95;;;;
3703;for those long time charlotteans like myself you may remember this place as the old manzetti's;;;;
3704;i'm going back soon! this place is a gotta try!;;;;
3705;while i don't have a green thumb i very much enjoy having low-maintenance plants around the house;;;;
3706;"it's nice to be able to walk into a bonafide garden centre and proclaim ""i just want a plant that's hard to kill,"" without the judgment! i've consistently found that the staff are helpful and courteous";;;;
3707;what's best is that they stand by their plants with a 3 month satisfaction guarantee!;;;;
3708;the food is great we did a rib eye & a sirloin pretty basic cuts both were done correctly;;;;
3709;the mushroom ravioli appetizer is special the tuna as well;;;;
3710;the decor is nice and makes this place a nice one for 'special' dinners;;;;
3711;as others have mentioned it is pricey with a good tip for good service we were at $185 for two appetizers two sides two steaks and one glass of wine;;;;
3712;hummm;;;;
3713;we used to come pretty frequently when it was joey's;;;;
3714;when they changed over to north and south we were a bit apprehensive about the addition of bbq and stayed away;;;;
3715;it took a yelp event to introduce us to the owners and the ways and whys of north and south;;;;
3716;it was great  talking with them about what's new and learning about the cooking processes;;;;
3717;we decided to try it out again after tasting their amazing st louis ribs;;;;
3718;we loved eating the ribs so much i wanted to get a smoker;;;;
3719;but why bother when you can save time by ordering by the pound! i've never been much of a ribs person but the entire family goes ga-ga over the ribs;;;;
3720;"it's like a ""don't you dare touch my leftovers"" kinda feeling after eating here";;;;
3721;the waitress/hostess we had was pretty awesome too;;;;
3722;her positive attitude and the info she provided about menu items made it a comfortable environment for us;;;;
3723;we'll be back!;;;;
3724;i did not stay at this hotel but i did visit the hotel and the shops;;;;
3725;beautiful place!!!! not too crowded very quiet and peaceful;;;;
3726;i love this place;;;;
3727;this hotel is located on the strip on the north end;;;;
3728;it's less crowded on the north and there is a mall right across the street;;;;
3729;this hotel has many high end stores for shopping such as lv cartier etc but there is a regular mall across the street with macy's forever 21 etc;;;;
3730;the gondola rides are nice but short!! it's 19;;;;
3731;95 a person and it's 10mins long;;;;
3732;they can stay in doors and out doors with the gondola;;;;
3733;i heard out door is better at night because of the lights;;;;
3734;great overall experience wonderful restaurants awesome shops;;;;
3735;maybe because it was rainy outside or the bartendress was on the rag but the service i experienced was atrocious;;;;
3736;this is after only my second experience here;;;;
3737;my first experience was in the summer where i hung around the bar (on the most uncomfortable chairs i've ever sat on) and things were pretty cheery;;;;
3738;this time i ordered from the happy hour menu & apparently when you do this you must sit at the bar---lame;;;;
3739;the bartendress was in a super bitchy mood and poked fun at the fact that i was ordering from the happy hour menu;;;;
3740;hello? we're not all snobby rich middle-aged myers park folk;;;;
3741;i prefer beer & i wanted some olde mecklenburg brewery mecktoberfest but the bartendress convinces me it isn't good because it's the last of the keg;;;;
3742;great;;;;
3743;personally i don't do cheap beer and nothing else looked good so i stuck with water;;;;
3744;"at this she snickers ""so just water and some apps";;;;
3745;"mmmkayy"" while giving stink eyes";;;;
3746;excuse me? who pissed in your cornflakes lady?;;;;
3747;eventually the order comes in;;;;
3748;risotto fritters gouda grilled cheese and tomato fondue koby beef sliders weird salmon dip;;;;
3749;all that was pretty good no complaints there;;;;
3750;this was the whole reason i came in the first place;;;;
3751;needless to say i left a good tip because i'm that kind of a guy;;;;
3752;but honestly this woman did not deserve one stinking penny and i'll probably never go back here because of her attitude;;;;
3753;it's sad to say because i live in this neighborhood and i like supporting this neighborhood's businesses;;;;
3754;i work with all sorts of people on a daily basis and work for tips myself and it benefits no one when you bring your foul mood to the table in fact it only detracts from possible future business;;;;
3755;excellent service quality;;;;
3756;i bought my car here and this is my car's first oil change service;;;;
3757;they are very professional;;;;
3758;i definitely recommend this place;;;;
3759;since i bought my car here they did everything free for first time;;;;
3760;i checked the receipt and the prices are decent when compared to other auto service centres;;;;
3761;out shopping (gross) i got a hankering for mexican food and border mx was the best rated option that came up;;;;
3762;overall food was pretty good (chimichanga al pastor flag enchilladas and guacamole and chips) - though it was really slow coming out (despite not being busy) and the enchiladas were not as hot as my missus expected they would be;;;;
3763;that said drinks (including really good micheladas) were good the guac was excellent and overall we left pretty happy (they yelp special churros were a nice touch) - not an area i'm in a lot but definitely impressed me with the authenticity - it was just the lag and the temperature of the food that was a little off;;;;
3764;if you like thin greasy pizza then alexander's pizza is good for you;;;;
3765;the $6 large pizza is a nice deal and i do admit the flavor is marginally better than caesar's $5 pizza;;;;
3766;the only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking wet from being drenched in oil;;;;
3767;alexander's pizza also serves italian and greek entree meals;;;;
3768;the pizza was disappointing but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! it's creamy thick and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads;;;;
3769;their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice;;;;
3770;not the friendliest bunch of people but you can tell their honest and work hard;;;;
3771;lovely food;;;;
3772;i am also happy to eat at this location of paradise bakery;;;;
3773;they have fresh ingredients and make good alterations if asked for;;;;
3774;great for vegetarians and well as non vegetarians;;;;
3775;fact that this location is in tempe marketplace makes a high difference so we can enjoy outdoor seating in evenings;;;;
3776;i loved my little cake but the owner is her own worst enemy to her business;;;;
3777;a friend took me there because we went on a cupcake tasting that day;;;;
3778;he said a better product was awaiting me as the grand finale;;;;
3779;when i walked in the store i didn't know who the owner was until my friend pointed it out when we left;;;;
3780;i wanted to take a look around it was nicely decorated but i could clearly see the person in charge slightly annoyed that i wanted to browse before buying;;;;
3781;i explained it my first time at the store and she pushed me to buy a large cake;;;;
3782;i explained again that i was not from scottsdale and am only one person;;;;
3783;so i'm not going to buy a large cake;;;;
3784;when we started talking a bit more i could see her employees sort of clam up;;;;
3785;i had no idea what was going on;;;;
3786;when i chose my little cake any sort of customer service went out the window once the money transaction occurred;;;;
3787;"she didn't even say ""thank you,"" it was so unusual for a bakery or any business dealing with customers";;;;
3788;i was upset and quite frankly so angry that i wanted to turn around an return my cake and tell the owner to keep my money;;;;
3789;i am not rich - i am passionate about bakeries and tour around when i'm in a new town to support local business;;;;
3790;i was genuinely interested in hearing about the seasonal cake that she was trying to sell me;;;;
3791;i had heard through other locals that they love the cakes but not the owner when she's in the shop because she's so rude;;;;
3792;i give this a two stars because i liked the cakes but the service was very very caustic that i could not justify scoring more;;;;
3793;she cuts people off  - that was feedback i had received from previous customers;;;;
3794;my local friends said that they cannot build rapport with the service workers there because there is always a new person;;;;
3795;that made me wonder what was going on;;;;
3796;i was trying to figure out how she stayed in business but then heard she has a contract that keeps her afloat to sell cakes to a prominent medical clinic;;;;
3797;i love the cakes there - the store is creative but i sense a level of stress that turned me off;;;;
3798;if it's the economy that's one thing but in the u;;;;
3799;customer service is not taken lightly and i will probably seek out another nothing bundt cakes for the product but not return due to the principle of how rude the service was;;;;
3800;having dined at many other vegas buffets (the wynn the paris the mirage etc;;;;
3801;) i found myself very underwhelmed;;;;
3802;everyone raves about the bellagio buffet but i just kept wishing i had gone to the wynn;;;;
3803;the decor is decent and the quality of the food is good but there wasn't much of an assortment;;;;
3804;i went for 4th of july brunch at around 11;;;;
3805;30am and the sushi bar wasn't open there was not a single pasta dish the slice of meat i got was fatty and veiny and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive;;;;
3806;i will say that the fruit was fresh and yummy (melon berries etc;;;;
3807;) and the desserts were good but it wasn't enough to make me want to come back here ever again;;;;
3808;i had two different experiences with carpet monkey;;;;
3809;in both instances the person who came to clean was on time and it was easy to get a hold of the company when i needed to;;;;
3810;also they call around 15-30 minutes beforehand to let you know they are on the way;;;;
3811;this is a great help since i had to drive 45 minutes to meet them so it was nice knowing how far they were;;;;
3812;their price was also quite good since i requested 4 rooms upstairs hallway stairs and downstairs bedroom;;;;
3813;now the first experience i had was on 09/15;;;;
3814;the person who came to clean was mark;;;;
3815;i was not satisfied at all with his work;;;;
3816;he didn't clean a good 2 inches from the walls around the whole perimeter of the house;;;;
3817;the stairs looked worse than before he came;;;;
3818;there were soo many stains that he said should come out that were still there and the carpet was extra crunchy after it dried;;;;
3819;any time we tried to mention something to him we would always get the same response that he's been doing this for 28 or 30 years and wouldn't really listen to our concern;;;;
3820;in a normal situation that would warrant an instant 1 star review since i chose this company based on over 500 positive reviews and the pictures seemed great;;;;
3821;the work i had gotten done on 09/15 was not anywhere near what the pictures looked like;;;;
3822;however instead of rushing to yelp i figured this company doesn't have 500 plus good reviews for nothing and called them up around 09/20;;;;
3823;this is where i can really appreciate this company's commitment to customers;;;;
3824;when i called i believe the owner picked up;;;;
3825;if i remember correctly his name was rick;;;;
3826;i told him everything that happened and he was very cooperative about the fact that i wasn't satisfied at all with mark's work;;;;
3827;he said he'll send his right hand man joe out and we were quickly able to schedule for 09/22;;;;
3828;again communication is very easy with this company;;;;
3829;on top of that rick told me the second visit wouldn't be of charge;;;;
3830;so saturday comes and we get a phone call from isaac saying he's on his way again great communication;;;;
3831;i didn't worry too much that it wasn't joe at our door like i was told since isaac seemed like he knew what to do in these situations where the previous work wasn't satisfactory;;;;
3832;he let me show him where i wasn't satisfied and could see where and why some of the stains didn't come out and said he'll go over all the areas;;;;
3833;i was surprised since i thought he'd just go over the areas with spots only;;;;
3834;but he went over everything all over again and everything looked a lot better;;;;
3835;the stairs actually looked like they had been cleaned this time and isaac also went ahead and did the risers which i wasn't expecting;;;;
3836;there were some stains that wouldn't come out but he had mentioned that to us;;;;
3837;overall his work actually resembled some of the yelp pictures and the carpets weren't nearly as crunchy when dried after isaac went over them;;;;
3838;he also put the corner protectors on the wall which i appreciated (something mark didn't do);;;;
3839;so my first experience was not good at all but the company was quick to help resolve the issue and reiterated how they wanted the customer to be happy and would do whatever they could to ensure that;;;;
3840;this alone earns praise from me since it shows they care enough to at least try and make things better;;;;
3841;second experience with isaac was way better and communication with the company is a breeze;;;;
3842;thank you isaac and rick!;;;;
3843;mike and his crew did a very good job on our backyard waterfall;;;;
3844;i waterfall is about 20 years old and had a lot of cracks and was leaking water;;;;
3845;we also had part of a palm tree growing out of the stonework;;;;
3846;he was very knowledgeable and experienced;;;;
3847;prompt to the minute! and we felt he did a very good job with his crew;;;;
3848;he was on site most of the time for the job and  would highly recommend using again;;;;
3849;the food is great and the prices are reasonable;;;;
3850;they give you a nice amount of food for what you pay for;;;;
3851;this is my new favorite restaurant in surprise which isn't very hard to do because surprise is full of nasty chain restaurants;;;;
3852;however if you want to eat some darn good vietnamese food this is the place;;;;
3853;the pho of any type is amazing even to go;;;;
3854;also try the spring rolls;;;;
3855;make sure you wrap them in the lettuce with a bit of mint the texture is bomb fool! it gets a little crowded around 6pm because all of sun city eats dinner around that time;;;;
3856;so show up around 7pm and you'll be fine;;;;
3857;it wasn't as great as expected;;;;
3858;i'm a crispy bacon guy! the bacon here was borderline crispy and too salty (surprisingly) the smoked salmon was extra salty;;;;
3859;the churros tasted funny and the chicken taquitos were flavorless;;;;
3860;the juice selection was limited;;;;
3861;apple orange and cranberry;;;;
3862;bring on grapefruit and pineapple! it wasn't all bad;;;;
3863;the breakfast potatoes corned beef hash turkey sausage and cheese grits were good;;;;
3864;great steak;;;;
3865;great service;;;;
3866;cool venue;;;;
3867;although it's died down a bit this place is still always on my radar for good food;;;;
3868;oh my gosh;;;;
3869;bombbbbbbbb!!! this place is so amazing!! the food is incredible! i have had almost everything on the menu;;;;
3870;they have milk shake happy hour every day between 3 p;;;;
3871;and 5 p;;;;
3872;with half price milkshakes;;;;
3873;the first time you go in tell them its your first time and they will give you a sample of all of their different sauces;;;;
3874;my two favorite are sweet heat and creamy garlic;;;;
3875;the staff is incredibly friendly and personable;;;;
3876;the restaurant is clean and the hand washing station is pretty neat;;;;
3877;go check it out you will not be disappointed!;;;;
3878;i have eaten at pan asian about 15+ times and have taken several friends here;;;;
3879;i give it 5 stars because the food is insanely good;;;;
3880;how anyone can give the food less than 5 stars is beyond me;;;;
3881;i am a food critic and have eaten at hundreds of restaurants;;;;
3882;pan asian is up there of one of my all time favorites;;;;
3883;how anyone can give this place less than 4 stars is beyond me;;;;
3884;there are always going to be those negative nellys that only look for what they can complain about;;;;
3885;i give the space and decor 4/5 stars - it is small and decor is minimal but it works;;;;
3886;miso soup massaman curry basil fried rice and a thai iced tea  is my fav at the moment and what i wish i was eating right now;;;;
3887;had the soup and sandwich;;;;
3888;wow it was great;;;;
3889;i can't wait to return;;;;
3890;if you can avoid this company i recommend you do so;;;;
3891;they are in the midst of overcharging me $100 for nothing and insist i have to prove i don't owe it by going to their inconveniently located offices;;;;
3892;they won't take a letter or fax;;;;
3893;rude on the phone to me;;;;
3894;you have to watch them every month as we have had other bills that were inaccurate (overbilling us) before too;;;;
3895;no i do not recommend;;;;
3896;i've waited 16 years to get this crazy rachet home tattoo covered up i'm celebrating 10!yrs of marriage and had to get this handled;;;;
3897;it had scarring it was bad!! josh came through like a champ his superrrr cool it was a longgg session but i took it like a g and now i'll be in the domican republic celebrating without having to worry about my back;;;;
3898;my tattoo looks amazing doesn't look like a cover up but most important for who ever is reading this;;;;
3899;your in bomb professional hands the vibe is comfortable and the people are chill;;;;
3900;god bless you and i'll be sending you lots of people thank you josh!!!!!!!!!!;;;;
3901;to be honest i was a bit disappointed;;;;
3902;had the original philly but it was so bland i even needed to add a bit of salt to bring out the flavor of the red sauce;;;;
3903;note;;;;
3904;the sauce is not at all spicy;;;;
3905;ill say they ensure to keep the food warm even for pick up so thats nice the cheese was still hot when i had it at home;;;;
3906;also the people are really polite and nice;;;;
3907;but not a place ill be trying anytime soon;;;;
3908;"dismal lukewarm defrosted-tasting ""texmex"" glop";;;;
3909;mumbly unengaged waiter;;;;
3910;clueless manager who seeing us with barely nibbled entrees;;;;
3911;on plates shoved forward for pickup thanked us;;;;
3912;perfunctorily for our patronage;;;;
3913;we're from the texas hill country;;;;
3914;down there we jail critters;;;;
3915;who serve up grub this bad,;;;;
3916;for their own protection;;;;
3917;never never never again;;;;
3918;(back to yard house for real food);;;;
3919;the only thing i found interesting about the place was the self tap tables which i didn't sit at;;;;
3920;the service was horrible my bloody mary was disgusting and the place was a sausage fest ( too many guys);;;;
3921;also i was extremely disappointed by the small dance floor;;;;
3922;i knew dierks bently was a sellout when they opened their bar in old town scottsdale;;;;
3923;this place is not true to country roots at all;;;;
3924;we ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the mgm grand);;;;
3925;it's a great before/after show restaurant;;;;
3926;we had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess;;;;
3927;the restaurant is open so you can see the bar kitchen and casino floor;;;;
3928;i ordered the special that night which was pappardelle pasta a chunky tomato sauce shredded lamb kale truffle-infused breadcrumbs and freshly shredded parmesan;;;;
3929;i was torn between several items on the menu but i wanted a special since i was in vegas for the weekend;;;;
3930;it was phenomenal! i rarely eat lamb and this was delicious;;;;
3931;it was incredibly tender and tasted delicious;;;;
3932;the sauce was very thick almost like tomato chunks but i didn't even feel like i was eating a tomato sauce;;;;
3933;the balance of sauce meat and kale was absolutely perfect;;;;
3934;i also had their moscow mule;;;;
3935;cocktails were expensive so i decided to go for one that was all alcohol;;;;
3936;others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty;;;;
3937;additionally i tried a few bites of what my friends had;;;;
3938;i had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs;;;;
3939;the meatball melts in your mouth and the sauce was phenomenal;;;;
3940;the linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams;;;;
3941;the french onion soup was rich buttery and tasted phenomenal;;;;
3942;"they brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote ""happy birthday"" in raspberry sauce";;;;
3943;the cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate;;;;
3944;the waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert;;;;
3945;yes this restaurant is pricey (although not by vegas standards);;;;
3946;however you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service;;;;
3947;the waiter took excellent care of us;;;;
3948;he was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly;;;;
3949;the bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed;;;;
3950;this is an incredibly unique delicious restaurant;;;;
3951;had a groupon decided to check it out steak was good server was lacking;;;;
3952;it was busy and loud which wasn't bad but it was our first time there so we weren't familiar withthe menu;;;;
3953;some of us had steak and some had salmon;;;;
3954;the salmon came with sides and the steak did not;;;;
3955;i wish the server would have told us more about the menu or asked if we wan't sides;;;;
3956;the server checked in once and never offered anyone a refill of their drinks;;;;
3957;it felt like they were put out by the groupon and didn't want to deal with us;;;;
3958;prob won't return;;;;
3959;best fried pickles in town! great prices fabulous and friendly staff;;;;
3960;zero complaints;;;;
3961;last year i was here on vacation;;;;
3962;we had a great experience which ultimately led us to spending a good amount of money;;;;
3963;i got a gorgeous pendant that i love;;;;
3964;their salesperson told me that my pendant was made of white gold;;;;
3965;i'm not quite sure what to believe but i love the pendant setting and the pearl of course;;;;
3966;the problem is that;;;;
3967;when i tried to wear the pendant regularly i found that my skin would rash wherever the pendant would be resting on;;;;
3968;my skin only rashes with low quality metals;;;;
3969;my skin doesn't rash with sterling silver or white gold which this business claims to sell;;;;
3970;i still love my pendant but i don't know what to do now;;;;
3971;i suppose just wear it once in a while for short periods of time;;;;
3972;it makes me sad because i really really like the pendant;;;;
3973;great customer service! lisa and marie were a big help with deciding what i needed;;;;
3974;with so many places to choose from it's great to find a national level business treat you like new neighbors;;;;
3975;first i want to say that our group had an amazing time at encore beach!!!!!  but we did end up dropping a ton of cash;;;;
3976;if you read the reviews carefully you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad or a couch area;;;;
3977;it was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables but i'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  we had a bottle of vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy;;;;
3978;"there was one ugly thing about this place though which is why i removed 1 star and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  it's insane!  it really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags but at least they let us put them together for $20 total";;;;
3979;jerks;;;;
3980;i'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags but they didn't tell us;;;;
3981;one other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving xs and he offered us free admission and a cabana for free;;;;
3982;we were like hell yes!!  and then we we get to encore beach the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves;;;;
3983;we were pretty pissed about that too but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying;;;;
3984;ok back to the good about this place;;;;
3985;the people are very friendly;;;;
3986;everyone's there to have a good time!  we talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  overall we just had sooooo much fun!  great music dancing in the pool and at our area;;;;
3987;it would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though;;;;
3988;so suck it up and pay or else stay at your hotel pool (which was also awesome at aria);;;;
3989;awesome smoke shop! can't say any bad things about this place;;;;
3990;the son and dad are really nice and provide great customer service;;;;
3991;i always come here for my hookah flavor and coal and will continue to do so!;;;;
3992;we had a great stay at the platinum;;;;
3993;i had no qualms at staying at a non-gaming (read;;;;
3994;not a casino) hotel off the strip;;;;
3995;it's a quick walk to all the action (about 5 to 10 minutes to the flamingo depending on how quick you pound the pavement);;;;
3996;the suites are large well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--i loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs;;;;
3997;the attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a king size bed;;;;
3998;as much as we liked the room we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the strip during much of the day and night;;;;
3999;kinda strange;;;;
4000;there was a box tv in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen tv in the living room;;;;
4001;not a big deal but perhaps a little outdated;;;;
4002;i never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet and i had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before i left the hotel);;;;
4003;the restaurant at the hotel served fairly yummy food at great prices (service was a little slow at times) but what was even beter was the killer happy hour at the lounge;;;;
4004;every day from 4 to 8 with half off all their appetizer menu signature cocktails wines by the glass bottles that are sold by the glass and then a selection of bottles that are served half off all day all night;;;;
4005;we frequented the happy hour several times during our trip and we were stoked every visit;;;;
4006;we plan on making this our home next time we stop in vegas;;;;
4007;it's the perfect getaway off the strip;;;;
4008;amazing burgers;;;;
4009;the combinations of ingredients is fantabulous;;;;
4010;it's difficult to have a favorite and yes i've had every item on the menu;;;;
4011;ok this buffet is pricey;;;;
4012;something in the neighborhood of $48 i think but if you go to the tix4tonight or similar vendors you can buy a voucher for $2 that gets you into the buffet for $33 and change so a total of $35;;;;
4013;a $10 savings;;;;
4014;a bottle of ok wine is 12 bucks and this becomes a really fun evening;;;;
4015;some complain that the food isn't prepared like some 5 star restaurant but guess what;;;;
4016;this isn't a 5 star restaurant;;;;
4017;it's a decent buffet where you can try a little or a lot of everything;;;;
4018;it's just fun and a lot cheaper than those fancy chef name places in the hotels;;;;
4019;oysters  crab all kinds of fish and shellfish and lobsters;;;;
4020;they have all of this and lots of veges and other dishes;;;;
4021;i really like the dessert selection but admittedly  when i am full of wine crab scallops and oysters the deserts start looking less attractive;;;;
4022;food critics say what you like;;;;
4023;the restaurant that fills up nightly for years and years is doing something that real people like! don't forget to hit the half price ticket place for your discount vouchers before you go!;;;;
4024;this place serves consistently good americanized middle eastern food;;;;
4025;i've had  tuna and lamb plates here and they've been good;;;;
4026;the flavors won't blow you away but just about everything on the menu is tasty and well prepared;;;;
4027;wait staff has been knowledgeable about the food each time i've been there;;;;
4028;waterworks location doesn't have a liquor license but there's a state wine store nearby and you can bring a bottle into the restaurant;;;;
4029;bruh i'm a stickler for good wings;;;;
4030;like to the point i can only eat them from about 4 places and i find those places to usually be inferior to the ones i make with my brother;;;;
4031;this place is a grade a dive and dump;;;;
4032;it is small old and needs remodeled  but the wings are still great!;;;;
4033;they get crispy right;;;;
4034;and the service was nice too;;;;
4035;the buffalo  (seems like a standard combo of whirl and franks) someone is mixed in a way that exceeds other standard buffalo combos;;;;
4036;also enjoyed the dry cajun;;;;
4037;the sirachi were a bit of a miss though;;;;
4038;also get the fries;;;;
4039;get a small because they give you so many but man they are good;;;;
4040;in short take it from a wing expert;;;;
4041;the bad reviews are bunk or are based on that customer having bad service;;;;
4042;despite the decor the food was amazing;;;;
4043;my dad and i had the fajtas the first night we were in scottsdale and boy were we surprised;;;;
4044;our waitress was amazing as she told us a unique way to get to the grand canyon which we didn't regret;;;;
4045;salsa was amazing and my mom probably ate most of it;;;;
4046;if i ever go back i hopefully will go back there for some mexican;;;;
4047;was there on 2/15/2012;;;;
4048;everything on the menu has a picture so you know what you're getting the coffee was on point and adorable foam design;;;;
4049;good tex;;;;
4050;mex food;;;;
4051;live close so easy for me;;;;
4052;good margaritas;;;;
4053;decent service;;;;
4054;prefer the local mexican places but this place is good and closeby;;;;
4055;upset that i don't get my work discount anymore;;;;
4056;-(  but will return;;;;
4057;the chips and salsa are so fresh and tasty that i could fill up on just those;;;;
4058;they're addictive! we love the paco's taco with braised beef and charro beans;;;;
4059;they have so many different tequilas & their drink menu is extensive and impressive;;;;
4060;margaritas are unbelievable;;;;
4061;highly recommended;;;;
4062;don't go here;;;;
4063;especially not for a full hour table massage;;;;
4064;i've never tried the chair massages so i can't speak to those but the table massage was not a great experience;;;;
4065;i'll spare the details but i definitely don't recommend this place;;;;
4066;great location;;;;
4067;convenient to the light rail and apartment complexes;;;;
4068;sea salt chocolate is my new favorite;;;;
4069;will be back for other flavors!;;;;
4070;been going here since summer i am so glad i have discovered this jem! this joint beats any other sushi spot even though its an izakaya;;;;
4071;the menu is extensive;;;;
4072;my faves are obviously tsuki don(a must try!) which no other place has grilled squid that is cooked to perfection which is also rare nowadays sashimi salad is to die for and tamaguro roll with red tuna tomatoes and garlic sauce;;;;
4073;i mean everything else that iv tried here is also delicious;;;;
4074;their lunch boxes are of a great value;;;;
4075;the place has great ambience and music service is always very consistent;;;;
4076;this place is good for a quick lunch big party or nice dinner;;;;
4077;its simply a spot to-go-to! can't wait to go back!;;;;
4078;love love love kelly's!   i just discovered this spot while i was doing the taste of scottsdale tour;;;;
4079;we stopped there for dessert;;;;
4080;the restaurant gives you the feel of an elegant irish pub;;;;
4081;"they have a pool table dart board putting green and huge patio!  in the past i always thought of kelly's as a bar or late night hang out (which is not really my thing) but i was very wrong!  their menu looked amazing!  they have an ""award winning"" four cut burger--which i will try next time!  dessert was delish!  we had the doughnut holes and kelly's twinkie";;;;
4082;both were excellent!;;;;
4083;i was most impressed with the service!  we were greeted right away;;;;
4084;while we were eating our dessert both a manager and the chef stopped by to check on us;;;;
4085;i was most impressed that the chef and manager cared so much about our experience!  a+ service!  i'm glad i found this new gem in old town scottsdale!;;;;
4086;i can't wait to go back to kelly's!;;;;
4087;where do i start!? came here for the first time today and was a little shocked at the prices;;;;
4088;we were already sitting down with our two little ones and they were hungry so we weren't going to try and look for another place to eat;;;;
4089;we ordered the fried pickles to start with and wow! i could not believe the size of these things! shortly after we got our meals and once again the portions were huge! i finally understood why things were priced the way they were;;;;
4090;everything was sooo good;;;;
4091;we will definitely eat here again!;;;;
4092;i was in mesa for the morning and found this gem;;;;
4093;i was greeted with a big smile and friendly service;;;;
4094;the almond latte was really good like really good! if i lived in mesa i'd be a regular for the friendliness good coffee and really nice environment;;;;
4095;it was busy but nice and quiet - a feature that seems a bit rare in my experience;;;;
4096;if i need coffee in mesa again this will be my go to place;;;;
4097;i've been debating about writing this review;;;;
4098;i love cupcakes and i was so excited when i so this store;;;;
4099;the store inside the mall is very cute;;;;
4100;the staff is amicable but not overly helpful;;;;
4101;which is ok the cupcakes look good however looks are not all even for cupcakes;;;;
4102;i got the lemon raspberry and the coconut as well as a key lime cake pop;;;;
4103;i tried the cake pop first;;;;
4104;it was gummy tasting and neon green;;;;
4105;i have been to key west and i never saw a neon green key lime;;;;
4106;then i took a bite out of the coconut one;;;;
4107;the cake per se was not bad however the frosting tasted like oil;;;;
4108;not appetizing;;;;
4109;so i closed the little container and tried the lemon raspberry;;;;
4110;i guess i have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town;;;;
4111;again the neon yellow color for the cake;;;;
4112;where do they get these citrus;;;;
4113;(see picture)  the cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store;;;;
4114;i ended up throwing them in my garbage making sure to smoosh it down in case i had a miranda moment (only if you have watched sex and the city you will get this);;;;
4115;at least i know i won't be tempted at the mall anymore;;;;
4116;i guess i should be thankful????;;;;
4117;a local favorite this hole in the wall serves home cooked food that does not disappoint;;;;
4118;i orders two eggs over easy with bacon and rye toast;;;;
4119;the food was cooked to order- hot tasty and the bacon was thick crisp and flavorful just like i hoped it would be;;;;
4120;the waitstaff is very friendly and took great care of us;;;;
4121;they chatted with everyone who came in and made them feel at home;;;;
4122;one reminder if you go;;;;
4123;bring cash;;;;
4124;no crest or debit cards taken here!;;;;
4125;"our nine person group stopped in while experiencing the ""glendale glitters"" celebration for dinner";;;;
4126;we tried to call ahead and make reservations but they informed me that they did not take reservations;;;;
4127;i have eaten here from the 1980's forward to today so i was familiar with the menu and layout;;;;
4128;it wasn't very busy and the hostess got us right in and let us pick out where we all wanted wanted to sit;;;;
4129;the menu felt abbreviated in relation to what i remembered from years past;;;;
4130;"maybe this was a limited holiday menu? anyway the food was ""good"" but nothing ""popped""";;;;
4131;i got the feeling the chips came out of a big bag not warm/hot;;;;
4132;"the salsa was ""ok"" but a little thin nothing on the menu that you couldn't find at any generic mexican style restaurant";;;;
4133;overall the meal was good and the price was reasonable but i was hoping to show the place off and i was sort of let down;;;;
4134;they did have live music and the guitar player/singer wasn't bad;;;;
4135;would i return?  yes for a quick lunch;;;;
4136;but i really think this place is performing below it's potential;;;;
4137;very impressed;;;;
4138;jim from dodge plumbing came out today and presented a very rational and logical argument for why his company should not take my money to convert over to an electric tank-less water heater due to out current logistics and electrical set up and why instead we should forgo this and stick with a gas system to save us money;;;;
4139;though they could have gone along with the estimate and soaked us for some money it was nice to get some honest feedback and jim seems to have a great deal of varied construction experience to give just that;;;;
4140;patio is great and spacious;;;;
4141;selection of beer and menu also great;;;;
4142;i came here because of the more sophisticated menu variety;;;;
4143;i ordered the steak tartare;;;;
4144;it's okay but if you've had steak tartare done right before skip it here;;;;
4145;they use a chicken egg yolk;;;;
4146;tartare itself is not seasoned enough and left more to be desired;;;;
4147;salmon quinoa bloated;;;;
4148;duck fries were quite good and a large portion too;;;;
4149;in terms of fruity beers i didn't like my friend's cherry beer (reminded me of medicine taste( but my peach beer was quite interesting and more bitter than i thought;;;;
4150;the seating with half booth half stools are a bit weird apparently my back doesn't like backless chairs;;;;
4151;either way i would come back if i want beer in a less rowdy bar with an interesting menu for food;;;;
4152;i made a yelp account just so i could write this review that's how rude the staff is here! the first time i came here i thought maybe it was just a one time thing;;;;
4153;but they are consistently unfailingly disrespectful;;;;
4154;i will never in my life come back here again;;;;
4155;as a resident of mountains edge its obvious we are missing the necessities;;;;
4156;trader joe's (i'll even settle for a sprouts) costco or a nice big gym;;;;
4157;but what we do have is this place!!  barking dogs is the only place i buy my dog phoebe's food and get her groomed;;;;
4158;phoebs is even on a first name basis in this local gem;;;;
4159;staff is very knowledgeable about all things dogs!!  they love your baby as much as you love them;;;;
4160;its literally less than a mile from my casa;;;;
4161;yes my pup and i are lucky and even spoiled with its location;;;;
4162;be jealous;;;;
4163;be very jealous;;;;
4164;pastries are pretty good but their iced coffee is terrible;;;;
4165;tastes more liked iced tea than iced coffee if i had to make a comparison but i've had much better iced tea even;;;;
4166;hate to say it i love local coffee shops but i can't recommend their coffee;;;;
4167;hope their food is better!;;;;
4168;guarantee you will leave with a full and happy tummy;;;;
4169;not only is the good great the customer service here is amazing;;;;
4170;can't beat their complementary bean dip and salsa! food is always fresh and never disappointing;;;;
4171;fajitas are always a good choice and when you order the fresh guac they'll prepare it at your table! it's like dinner and a show! will definitely be back whenever i'm in town!;;;;
4172;i recently visited pieology for the first time with friends recently and was really pleased with the selection and taste of the pies;;;;
4173;for a set price you can pick your crust base sauce and toppings regardless of the amount and variety;;;;
4174;the pizzas are made to order and placed in the oven for maybe 5-10 minutes;;;;
4175;there are gluten-free options as well for those that need;;;;
4176;overall i'd have to say i'm a fan of pieology now and will return in the future;;;;
4177;staff is friendly and efficient;;;;
4178;it was a relatively quiet late afternoon so the wait was negligible;;;;
4179;check it out;;;;
4180;i've eaten at this location twice;;;;
4181;the first time i got a falafel to go;;;;
4182;i thought the cilantro was a bit much for the falafel it wasn't what i've been used to in the past;;;;
4183;i like a milder basic falafel;;;;
4184;today i had a shawarma pita and it was really good;;;;
4185;a little heavy on the red onions so next time i plan to ask for no onions! the price is great for the amount of good you get;;;;
4186;my pita's are always loaded up;;;;
4187;had a good protein omlete;;;;
4188;flavorful food and staff was friendly;;;;
4189;i will go back and try some of the other dishes;;;;
4190;please do not eat at this place i'm scared of this food;;;;
4191;the worst part is the service and the trashy anti-family anti-american atmosphere;;;;
4192;please stay away;;;;
4193;troy did my recessed lighting back in january and he did an amazing job;;;;
4194;our home was a struggle since our ceilings were about 16-17ft high and he got the job done fast easy and it was beautiful;;;;
4195;great experience;;;;
4196;delicious oatmeal raisin cookie;;;;
4197;cute little spot and decor;;;;
4198;nice little place to sit and chat over coffee or lunch;;;;
4199;after a spontaneous visit to piccadilly i am sold on their artisan organic froyo (with vegan options!) i was skeptical which is why i held out for so long on a visit;;;;
4200;but i was very pleased with the overall experience;;;;
4201;the decor is trendy and interesting it's cleveland-centric and they offer great vegan options;;;;
4202;when our group entered the store we were warmly welcomed and given an explanation of how everything worked;;;;
4203;it's a per-ounce froyo place with lots of possibilities;;;;
4204;i chose the artisan organic tart yogurt and the vegan blueberry;;;;
4205;mmm;;;;
4206;one thing to note is that because it's vegan (made with coconut milk) it's not as creamy and melts a bit quicker if you're not used to vegan things;;;;
4207;yum;;;;
4208;they have lots of topping options along with organic mochi and tons of fruit;;;;
4209;they also have nutella and flavored bubbles! i usually go with the mochi and fruit with froyo and all of it was very fresh;;;;
4210;it turned out to be a bit pricy but i'm willing to pay for it - the whole thing from the froyo to the overall experience;;;;
4211;this place is the best;;;;
4212;my friends and i get takeout from here all the time and it's great because i can exercise my total indecision right up to choosing food because they have sooooooo many choices;;;;
4213;thai? vietnamese? chinese? sushi? tottie's has it all and it is all delicious;;;;
4214;sugar cane chicken? pho? pad thai? what are you in the mood for!? the prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are decent not overwhelming but everything is flavorful and distinctive;;;;
4215;way overrated owner and manager have a seriously lousy attitude;;;;
4216;overpriced for sure;;;;
4217;bumpers is the place to go for the crab legs not mushy like pickle bills;;;;
4218;they have the river right outside the place so they feel they can justify the increased pricing;;;;
4219;food was pretty good however the prices are high;;;;
4220;waitress did a great job until she asked if i needed change;;;;
4221;i booked a session and decided to also use my coupon for free easter collage;;;;
4222;the girl told me it would take 45 min to print;;;;
4223;showed up 45min later and i guess they were having issues formatting it to print out correctly;;;;
4224;hour and a half total spent waiting and the guy kept saying if you wait i'll give a free print;;;;
4225;i had already waited hour and a half along with session time and a five month old wasn't going to deal with it much longer;;;;
4226;i don't travel to chandler often and live 30min from this location;;;;
4227;i told them they needed to mail it to me and i left furious;;;;
4228;never again!;;;;
4229;update;;;;
4230;the area manager did contact me and had my missing photos mailed and also had one of them framed for me;;;;
4231;"holy ""made fresh at your table"" guacamole!!!  my heart skips a beat just thinking about it";;;;
4232;tex-mex fine dining;;;;
4233;at it's finest;;;;
4234;also an important note;;;;
4235;one of my top five places to drink a house margarita;;;;
4236;as a long-time fan of chick-fil-a i wasn't walking in expecting to be comparing the two;;;;
4237;but as we ordered sat down and were served i couldn't help it;;;;
4238;the service is as good if not better here than at cfa;;;;
4239;the sauces are better and so is the chicken! everything was very clean and we were thoroughly impressed;;;;
4240;i would like more sandwich options--i think next time i'll just be getting chicken strips because i ended up eating just the chicken off my pimento crunch sandwich;;;;
4241;very impressed!!!;;;;
4242;came here on a whim to try it out with my fiancã©e and we were not impressed at all;;;;
4243;ordered the street corn queso and it was super lacking on flavor and also pulled a large chunk of butter from it;;;;
4244;tried to save it a little with the sauce tray and even added salsa to it and still wasn't there;;;;
4245;my sonoran dog looked like it was from the previous day;;;;
4246;typical dry wrinkled no snap day-old dog the brioche bun was soggy from too much butter;;;;
4247;and the tacos were cold;;;;
4248;we couldn't even finish the meal;;;;
4249;the salsa was the only highlight of the lunch;;;;
4250;also watched a server shatter a glass over the ice well and proceed to use the ice that the glass had broken into to serve a customer;;;;
4251;i will never return;;;;
4252;very disappointing the price is too expensive for the food quality;;;;
4253;first of all there is no green tea or red bean  ice cream on the menu;;;;
4254;they only have ice cream bar and it is only one per person on the menu they didn't say that is limited;;;;
4255;secondly way too much rice on the sushi;;;;
4256;i guess thats how they make the money;;;;
4257;lastly the ipad service is stupid;;;;
4258;you have to wait for someone to confirm it;;;;
4259;overall not a good reataurant for sushi;;;;
4260;pretty much the same food you can get at every other panda express across the country - quick-serve chinese;;;;
4261;nothing wrong with it but nothing grand either;;;;
4262;the good news is that it wasn't going to slow down our trip nor was it going to set us back a ridiculous amount either;;;;
4263;great food;;;;
4264;try the chop its huge;;;;
4265;friendly service and down home atmosphere;;;;
4266;there was hair in our food and drinks - multiple times!  we had to send out food and drinks back 3 different times;;;;
4267;we were about 10 deep in out party;;;;
4268;2 booths seated directly next to each other;;;;
4269;one table ordered chicken tacos;;;;
4270;the minute the server sat the plate down we noticed there was hair in it;;;;
4271;she took it right back;;;;
4272;one of our margaritas came out immediately after;;;;
4273;there was a long strain of hair floating on top;;;;
4274;the server took it right away and apologized - again;;;;
4275;the other table ordered nachos;;;;
4276;and guess what;;;;
4277;hair was it;;;;
4278;stuck in the queso;;;;
4279;this time the server stood there and waited until we looked over the nachos;;;;
4280;we both noticed the hair;;;;
4281;he said wow!  you guys see it's not my hair (he had a short brown cut with a cap on);;;;
4282;he again returned the nachos and we decided not to order anything else;;;;
4283;i'll never return!;;;;
4284;they worry about their therapist but not their customers;;;;
4285;i've been going on here for awhile and one time i missed and forgot about my appointment they charged me $60;;;;
4286;they said that's the least they charge;;;;
4287;normally it's full price of your service;;;;
4288;if it was so important not to miss an appointment why don't they give an automated text reminder within 1-2 hours of appointment like other places???;;;;
4289;great place for a smaller breakfast and pretty great coffee as well;;;;
4290;so idk why ppl are giving this place such a hard time;;;;
4291;i'm reviewing for edc weekend;;;;
4292;we checked in thursday (the 20th);;;;
4293;the guy up front gave me great service;;;;
4294;if you're looking for a place just to crash it's not bad;;;;
4295;nice location;;;;
4296;mid strip;;;;
4297;kinda hidden though;;;;
4298;it was a bit hard to get ppl to find us haha;;;;
4299;don't expect a hot tub or something fancy;;;;
4300;like i said just a place to crash;;;;
4301;the most important thing for a restaurant is food safety and clean;;;;
4302;see what i got from my dish;;;;
4303;other bugs maybe still forgivable;;;;
4304;but cockroach means this restaurant is really dirty nasty and not take their kitchen clean job seriously;;;;
4305;my wife and i participated in the ms walk and decided it was the perfect opportunity to give the famous river cafe a try;;;;
4306;what a beautiful spot and a great ambience;;;;
4307;we were greeted by a couple friendly hostesses and shown to an indoor table as the patio was full;;;;
4308;we got a great spot by the window that opened so a great compromise;;;;
4309;the experience;;;;
4310;the menu did not have a lot of lunch options (brunch was the focus of the day) and the ones that were offered were somewhat difficult to figure out;;;;
4311;frustrated i ordered the bison burger and my wife had the flatbread;;;;
4312;the food came quickly enough (wasn't busy) but that is where it all went awry;;;;
4313;the bison burger was small yet i could not finish it as there was a strange flavour to it that made it sickening after a while;;;;
4314;the potato salad that accompanied it was good;;;;
4315;the flat bread was not good;;;;
4316;there must have been something wrong with it as it had a sweet but pungent smell (and taste) to it;;;;
4317;we are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird;;;;
4318;the server did concur that something seemed off and promptly took the item off the bill which was appreciated but also expected as it was not edible;;;;
4319;overall i am glad we went because we had been wondering about this place but i would be very hesitant to go back;;;;
4320;even though i haven't had much luck at this location over the years i still stop by when i am at this mall;;;;
4321;i'm still a longtime fan of the brand (since high school mind you) and i am still optimistic;;;;
4322;i've been looking at this black wool boucle motorcycle jacket and now it's on sale for $49;;;;
4323;99 (regular price $89;;;;
4324;99);;;;
4325;i tried it on today and it fits me like a dream;;;;
4326;my husband says that i have enough jackets though;;;;
4327;but i am still debating;;;;
4328;after all i need to shop for my next trip to hawaii (next month) and comfy shoes are on the top of that list (we are pretty active on our vacations and walking is an everyday thing for us);;;;
4329;the layout of the store recently changed;;;;
4330;the women's clearance section is on the far right of the store near the dressing rooms;;;;
4331;the rest of the markdowns really weren't too impressive;;;;
4332;some jeans were marked down to $49;;;;
4333;generally i don't buy jeans at that price;;;;
4334;see i'm searching for the best deal and that's still pretty high for me;;;;
4335;i'm sure that i will still stop in though in the future due to my optimism and love for the brand;;;;
4336;best barbecue this side of the mississippi!!!! come here your car washed and detailed pick up some petroleum and slap your lips around the best barbecue you've had in arizona!!! hot diggity !!!;;;;
4337;great and fresh food (had filet mignon and asparagus) quick and friendly service and warm atmosphere are the reasons for my 5 star rating;;;;
4338;they were very busy for 9pm on a tuesday night so the locals love it;;;;
4339;the bar area is good for dining too;;;;
4340;tv's with baseball playoffs were good for entertainment;;;;
4341;this is my very first bike! jt was very helpful along with his staff! very friendly and they really take their time to help you and find what you need! i was there for a really long time but i never got the feeling that i was an annoyance;;;;
4342;they really take go out of their way to make sure you get all the answers to make an informed decision;;;;
4343;nonetheless i would highly recommend coming here!;;;;
4344;we checked this place out for dinner during race weeks;;;;
4345;it was alllright;;;;
4346;"ordered the ""thunder thighs"" - which sounded like buffalo wings made w chicken thighs but ended up w regular wings";;;;
4347;not sure if we got the wrong order or if they are just called thighs when they are wings;;;;
4348;either way i was disappointed but the wings were pretty decent after i got over the sadness;;;;
4349;at our table we had a chicken sandwich a sausage and pepper hoagie and a pork chop;;;;
4350;the chicken was reported as good (wasn't mine) the pork was ok but not out of this world and the sausage was messy but good - had marinara sauce on it which was unexpected;;;;
4351;the mac and cheese was a little greasy but pretty good;;;;
4352;"as for the ""biker bar"" label";;;;
4353;i saw about 2 bikers and the rest of the crowd was regular peeps;;;;
4354;the girls wear skimpy outfits so its not a family place for sure;;;;
4355;it was ok but i'm not dying to go back right away;;;;
4356;to whomever owns lucki thai;;;;
4357;lucki is actually spelled with a y;;;;
4358;sheesh how embarrassing;;;;
4359;beyond the (yes i do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant lucki thai doesn't miss on many marks for me;;;;
4360;i've had the opportuniti to dine in get carri out and order deliveri (i'll stop this now) from lucki on many occasions in the last few months so i can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed;;;;
4361;the first time i had lucki i dined in and had the tom yum soup with shrimp and their crab fried rice;;;;
4362;the tom yum soup is consistently good and i'd know since it's been a staple of every single order i've made with lucki since;;;;
4363;it's always hot with the perfect combination of sour and spicy and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp;;;;
4364;the large order feeds 2 perfectly;;;;
4365;the crab fried rice is not something i tend to order but lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor;;;;
4366;they also weren't shy with the egg on the rice and being an egg slut like anthony bourdain that pleased me;;;;
4367;i've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before) and the food has almost always been ready to go when i arrive for a carry-out order;;;;
4368;of the items i've ordered those times the curries have been phenomenal as has the spicy eggplant entree;;;;
4369;i wish i could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that i've had similar dishes but i usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable;;;;
4370;i'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option even though it's $2 extra;;;;
4371;lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that i feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it;;;;
4372;i'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice;;;;
4373;i also really liked the rad na though my laziness knows no bounds in that i felt like it was a lot of work eating it;;;;
4374;it's truly shameful;;;;
4375;the only order i wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the beef pad see ewe;;;;
4376;the flavors were nice but the beef was tough and chewy;;;;
4377;a simple misstep which i can forgive;;;;
4378;i have to admit i almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with lucki thai thus far;;;;
4379;spice consistency;;;;
4380;i started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other thai joints but didn't find them spicy enough;;;;
4381;i've now settled on an 8 which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow;;;;
4382;getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8 it had literally zero spice;;;;
4383;it actually might have gotten into the negatives;;;;
4384;it's quite frustrating because i suspect if i move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan;;;;
4385;what's my next move here?;;;;
4386;but alas the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci;;;;
4387;sorry i couldn't resist;;;;
4388;do not use;;;;
4389;should be call unreliable towing service;;;;
4390;never showed up;;;;
4391;kept saying they were minutes away;;;;
4392;the food was great!  when we walked in  only one dark haired guy greeted us and i said it was our first time in to which he said nothing;;;;
4393;then we ordered 3 salads  4 meatballs  one cheesy bread and one order of 4 canolis to go;;;;
4394;the order took about 25 mins to fill;;;;
4395;we sat at an old card table that appeared to be in need of replacement;;;;
4396;two chairs only so we grabbed another for our third person;;;;
4397;leaving room only for two tables with one chair each;;;;
4398;then we used the restroom which wasn't clean at although tp was provided;;;;
4399;while the same guy who took our order prepared our food another customer came in and stood probably five mins for the guy making the food to come out and give our order;;;;
4400;the customer left as no one came out to get his order;;;;
4401;then we finally got our food brought out in plastic to go containers;;;;
4402;the salads were delicious in spite of the dry chicken;;;;
4403;all the dressing was in small individual servings that you had to open;;;;
4404;the meatballs were fantastic and moist;;;;
4405;best i've had;;;;
4406;the cheesy bread was also delicious;;;;
4407;the dining room was very small and i think it's geared towards pick up and take out mostly;;;;
4408;not an enjoyable environment for dinner;;;;
4409;great food;;;;
4410;though i would only get takeout;;;;
4411;when i eat in i like real plates and silverware;;;;
4412;also  nice to get appetizer before main course instead of after;;;;
4413;food was good;;;;
4414;one star for dining room experience;;;;
4415;yum! i could eat it every day;;;;
4416;"my favorite is the ""special"" burro";;;;
4417;my second would have to be the two tacos;;;;
4418;beef or chicken both delicious;;;;
4419;affordable quick and take some tortillas home for later;;;;
4420;mexican cafe with lively atmosphere and decent pricing;;;;
4421;this place was not at all what i expected from the outside;;;;
4422;i used to come here when it was a place called m;;;;
4423;it was totally totally different then;;;;
4424;anyway it's now a very very bright and colorful mexican cafe;;;;
4425;enchiladas with boom boom sauce and mango margaritas were good;;;;
4426;i think i'd like to come back in summer and sit on the huge patio;;;;
4427;really good tres leches cake too;;;;
4428;i just can't get over the interior though - i think the lighting is just so bright they would do themselves a favor to get a lighting scheme designer to come in and adjust things a bit - make it less of a cafeteria;;;;
4429;it reminds me of a place in california - chevy's;;;;
4430;same sort of set up and theme;;;;
4431;lots of families and kids;;;;
4432;no sense of intimacy - so not a date spot for sure - a good casual place to chill after shopping at the pottery barn though;;;;
4433;the server we had was a little sleepy but he was nice;;;;
4434;i think he needed a nap though;;;;
4435;"this is one of the best ""hole in the wall"" spots i've been to in years! fresh home-made tortillas great steak people are amazing! i came with a party of 10 ppl and the food was fast delicious and prefer was perfect";;;;
4436;i will definitely be back!;;;;
4437;their specialty dishes are very unique;;;;
4438;the spicy tuna nachos are amazing;;;;
4439;some of my favorites are;;;;
4440;lemon roll and the edamame is a must;;;;
4441;for desert also try the chocolate chip cookie with fudge and vanilla ice cream - yummy;;;;
4442;we celebrated a birthday in the tatami room;;;;
4443;beautiful private room we sat on cushions  in a very cozy setting;;;;
4444;wow! what a great sub;;;;
4445;all of them are fantastic;;;;
4446;i especially like the rosemary bun;;;;
4447;the staff are alway great too and  have a up beat and positive attitude;;;;
4448;perfect for a quick lunch;;;;
4449;i was sent to vision source south hills for a second opinion;;;;
4450;i enjoyed my appointments with dr;;;;
4451;strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive;;;;
4452;however i was incredibly displeased with how i was treated by the staff;;;;
4453;i went through my vision insurance with a staff member and assumed this information was added to my file;;;;
4454;i called a month or so later to order contacts and was told i could not pay for the contacts when i came and picked them up;;;;
4455;i needed to pay for them over the phone;;;;
4456;i have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but i figured it wasn't a big deal just differences between offices;;;;
4457;once i got the statement for my order i realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company;;;;
4458;i called back and was met with no answers saying they would call me back later;;;;
4459;they never did so i called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file;;;;
4460;after going through my information a second time they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and i would receive a check soon;;;;
4461;never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake;;;;
4462;in fact everyone i talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim;;;;
4463;a month later i received my refund along with an updated billing statement;;;;
4464;amongst the revised patient/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary;;;;
4465;it read;;;;
4466;"""patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance""";;;;
4467;this is the first medical establishment i have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance;;;;
4468;professional medical establishments run benefit checks and inform the customer of their costs prior to performing the service;;;;
4469;while i feel dr;;;;
4470;strain is a highly qualified ophthalmologist i am exceedingly disappointed in the professionalism and efficiency of the office staff;;;;
4471;at this point i do not see myself returning in the future;;;;
4472;"i've had their ""cleveland's"" breakfast many times and it is perfect every time";;;;
4473;the best eggs and sausage breakfast in town;;;;
4474;i don't know how they do it but their scrambled eggs are the best i've ever had;;;;
4475;i've tried to duplicate it at home without success;;;;
4476;i get the same thing every time i go;;;;
4477;scrambled eggs with sausage potatoes and toast with a side of guinness;;;;
4478;yum!;;;;
4479;great parathas;;;;
4480;a little pricey;;;;
4481;the service could be better;;;;
4482;but going into an indian fast-food place i had a very low expectation;;;;
4483;the place wasn't so clean but oh well;;;;
4484;the food made up for it;;;;
4485;we went back three times during our 6 days trip to vegas;;;;
4486;alway stop when we're in town;;;;
4487;amazing fresh food;;;;
4488;really good prices;;;;
4489;friendly  service;;;;
4490;drink menu has a good variety as well;;;;
4491;i'm from la and been looking for an awesome cut here in vegas;;;;
4492;i got that here from favio;;;;
4493;he took his time and gave me exactly what i wanted;;;;
4494;i'll definitely be back!;;;;
4495;it's awesome here!!the guys are soooo hot and nice!!the host london is amazing at the mic and getting the crowd excited!!highly recommend this place!!;;;;
4496;we've always been customers of petco;;;;
4497;we like the layout and the products they carry;;;;
4498;"of course you can find some of the products cheaper elsewhere but we're fans of ""one-stop-shop""";;;;
4499;one of our dogs comes here for his monthly wash and brushout they ladies are great with him;;;;
4500;"they also have a woman who is ""certified"" for cats didn't know you needed to be certified but i guess it's a good idea";;;;
4501;friendly staff and a great dog trainer too!;;;;
4502;we dropped by in hopes of finding atkinson's peanut butter bars(we first tried them from honey salt's candy bowl ) and after searching a few minutes we found it;;;;
4503;i was also bummed that stores didn't carry peanut butter twix anymore but now i'm happy that they can also be found at rocket fizz;;;;
4504;on our way out wifey grabbed an rc cola and i tried a key lime pie soda which was pretty good;;;;
4505;if you're searching for a candy or soda pop you grew up with and can no longer find there's a good chance you'll find it here;;;;
4506;if only now and later would bring back their bubble gum flavored taffy and if tidal wave gum came back to life;;;;
4507;the green apple was my favorite!;;;;
4508;aloha!!!;;;;
4509;"yelp 100 challenge 2013-(3/100) ""  our retro return""";;;;
4510;two thumbs up!!!!;;;;
4511;pho (soup) and their banh minhs (sandwiches) are to die for!!! not to mention their chinese food choices!!!! this place is a hole in the wall but their food choices are awesome!!!;;;;
4512;located 5 miles from the airport no traffic parking is not a problem either!!!!;;;;
4513;the staff are courteous and gets your order right!!!;;;;
4514;fresher noodles you may not find in this town i tried the steamed vegetable dumplings and the chicken noodle soup - loved it! but careful the portions are big but the staff box it nicely and it still that's great next day;;;;
4515;also the mango bubble tea was tasty;;;;
4516;the draft beer selection is great the tapas style menu is a perfect match and the upstairs is a great after work gathering place;;;;
4517;but the best thing about this place is the bartender named siti (sp) he is one of the best in charlotte;;;;
4518;excellent ramen and one of the best restaurants in charlotte;;;;
4519;very small area and limited seating so arrive early or be ready to wait;;;;
4520;recommend all the bowls sake flights and be sure to get green tea ice cream;;;;
4521;had an awesome breakfast cum brunch;;;;
4522;staff is very warm and courteous and delicious food;;;;
4523;"went to see the exhibit ""killer heels"" and was greatly surprised";;;;
4524;the shoes that were there were breathtaking for a real show lover like me;;;;
4525;everything from classic pravda to crazy lady gaga shoes;;;;
4526;it was a great girls day on a hot day;;;;
4527;fresh and quality sashimi and great lunch time prices;;;;
4528;i tried it for lunch once and i am a fan there are few quality japanese restaurants in the city but this is amazing (even though it's korean owned) and great value for the money;;;;
4529;great decor and swift service;;;;
4530;great ambience and decor! and the food is delicious;;;;
4531;pan fried fish street side indian noodles hongkong chicken are a few names to start with !;;;;
4532;ice cream is ok;;;;
4533;to pricey;;;;
4534;bought two cones and was charged $20;;;;
4535;00 for a cone and one scoop!  first and most likely our last time;;;;
4536;there are other places with great flavors and very reasonable prices;;;;
4537;after living in tempe for several months and not finding a nail salon i went on yelp;;;;
4538;) and found nancy's;;;;
4539;the reviews looked pretty good so i decided to give it a try;;;;
4540;like some of the other reviews mentioned the salon doesn't look like much from the outside but on the inside everything is great;;;;
4541;the facility is clean but what makes the difference for me is the fact that the staff there was so friendly and welcoming;;;;
4542;all of the technicians were talking with the clients and there were even a few friendly group conversations between everyone in the salon;;;;
4543;it was very comfortable! most of the ladies in there during my appointment were regular clients and they had nothing but good things to say about the place after learning that it was my first time there;;;;
4544;loyal clientele is always a good sign;;;;
4545;johnny did my acrylic nails (full set) which i am totally in love with;;;;
4546;he did a great job and was also really personable;;;;
4547;another awesome thing about this salon is that they offer a 5% discount to anyone that pays in cash! 5% isn't a lot but it's still a pretty cool little perk;;;;
4548;i will definitely be returning;;;;
4549;one of my favorite breakfast place to go to with my high school son;;;;
4550;he loves the food;;;;
4551;we both love a good breakfast joint;;;;
4552;we went here for the 1st time this evening and really enjoyed it - great ambiance delicious food with amazing flavors and good service;;;;
4553;we really liked the fresh roll spring rolls dumplings wild curry (good spice!) and basil chicken;;;;
4554;they served healthy portions;;;;
4555;cash only & byob;;;;
4556;we will definitely return!;;;;
4557;my husband and i ordered our wedding cake here;;;;
4558;we saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big julia robert's movie and really wanted that one;;;;
4559;we went in to baker wee to see if they could make it;;;;
4560;the owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway;;;;
4561;she saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for;;;;
4562;we even made a 2d drawing of it she wrote down her notes and took the order;;;;
4563;she said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it;;;;
4564;fast forward to our wedding day;;;;
4565;we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake;;;;
4566;wow! we almost fainted;;;;
4567;i should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was;;;;
4568;"the original agreement in size was a 12"" x 12"" square and 10-12"" tall like i said pyramid";;;;
4569;"we got an 8"" square base next layer 6"" base and the top layer 4"" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! it looked like a chinese pagoda";;;;
4570;"the layers were on 4"" tall sticks";;;;
4571;and the best part;;;;
4572;"it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2"" diameter ball on the top";;;;
4573;-   turned out the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake never called us or the manager lady with questions just tried to figure it out from the her notes;;;;
4574;this was her understanding of it;;;;
4575;we were so embarrassed all night everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? we just kept saying;;;;
4576;a snow white pyramid;;;;
4577;next morning we drove down to the bakery furious;;;;
4578;she said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best;;;;
4579;she said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free;;;;
4580;we did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to baker wee again;;;;
4581;it's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day;;;;
4582;we should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything;;;;
4583;after all we didn't want the money we wanted the cake;;;;
4584;so anyway i would not recommend them if they were the last bakery i  would rather make a homemade cake;;;;
4585;i also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on;;;;
4586;i went to itech customs for just a quick quote on my iphone6s screen/ front camera crack;;;;
4587;itech fixed it all for $75 when sprint was going to charge me over $150;;;;
4588;thank you & i will definitely be back for any issues that i have with phone repair! i'm extremely happy and impressed! i'm recommending itech customs to all of my friend!!;;;;
4589;we chose this place to split lunch and it was an excellent choice;;;;
4590;waiter was very enthusiast and funny;;;;
4591;had a good beer selection (mostly bottles) which was refreshing after much walking;;;;
4592;blt fried green tomato appetizer is a must have;;;;
4593;we split the blue plate for our meal;;;;
4594;watermelon was tasty chicken as well;;;;
4595;chicken wasn't anything special for me but i am by no means a fried chicken expert;;;;
4596;only downfall was restaurant was a bit dark for lunch;;;;
4597;enjoyed nee house immensely;;;;
4598;no service issues just fantastic chinese food;;;;
4599;food order? spicy green beans = perfect! chow fun (chicken) = perfect!;;;;
4600;just a great place;;;;
4601;perhaps my expectations were set by all the bad service reviews but i was not disappointed;;;;
4602;in town for a convention and looking for something away from the strip;;;;
4603;found this place on yelp and was not disappointed;;;;
4604;mango margaritas were tasty as were the shrimp tacos;;;;
4605;the waiter mistakenly brought me the fish tacos (which were actually quite good as well) and was very apologetic when i pointed this out;;;;
4606;he then replaced them as quickly as possible;;;;
4607;had a 30 minute wait;;;;
4608;but played foosball (sow) to pass the time!;;;;
4609;the brisket nacho were really good!;;;;
4610;the bacon mac-n-cheese burger was good but not great!;;;;
4611;the motley cue sandwich was rally good;;;;
4612;lots of mean;;;;
4613;could probably split between 2 people;;;;
4614;the wings;;;;
4615;cutest presentation;;;;
4616;staff was eh;;;;
4617;i mean the place is busy;;;;
4618;no time to be too friendly to all the damn tourist;;;;
4619;can't say that i blame them;;;;
4620;neat experience;;;;
4621;def worth a trip;;;;
4622;next time will def try the desert;;;;
4623;this time we were too full!;;;;
4624;got a chance to check out this spot while catching up with a business contact for coffee;;;;
4625;the gentleman working this morning was patient in explaining their offerings;;;;
4626;the coffee was smooth and only needed a bit of almond milk - kudos to the cafe for having that as an available option;;;;
4627;i had the pleasure of enjoying the croissant it had the right amount of flakiness and was bigger than expected;;;;
4628;the atmosphere was casual and laid back;;;;
4629;i now look forward to trying this place out later in the day;;;;
4630;we just used honest air for the second time this year because they most certainly live up to their name;;;;
4631;the first time was in the heat of the summer when water started dripping from the ceiling;;;;
4632;our home warranty said it would be four days (it was a saturday my husband was out of town and my elderly parents were staying with me) before anyone could be out to service our home so i immediately looked up local companies myself and called honest air at 3;;;;
4633;30pm on a saturday and had someone out to my house by 4pm;;;;
4634;the gentleman that showed up was instantly able to locate the problem and solution - terrible install design by the home builders - and my dad actually was able to make the repair with the technician's directions;;;;
4635;the service charge was more than reasonable and i was just relieved to be able to continue using the ac;;;;
4636;we just called them out again today to check our system as the vents do not blow equally throughout the house resulting in hot spots and cool spots;;;;
4637;the very same technician came out and looked at our system again - and again all of our issues are due to how cheaply made the house was back in 1999 - and spent about 20 minutes teaching us how to have better air flow and utilize the vents in the house wisely;;;;
4638;he was very kind respectful and clean;;;;
4639;whenever we need our ac or furnace repaired replaced or even just checked up on we will always be using honest air;;;;
4640;gorgeous hotel! i felt like a vip;;;;
4641;definitely the next best thing to the real venice in my opinion;;;;
4642;lots of pools to choose from and great casino;;;;
4643;convenient location- close to everything;;;;
4644;would definitely go there again;;;;
4645;yes! as good as it gets in way of pinball machines! my parents and i had so much fun crossing this one off the bucket list;;;;
4646;plus we each got to take a walk down memory lane looking at all the machines;;;;
4647;we loved how each machine told the history year etc;;;;
4648;keep up the good work pinballers!;;;;
4649;besides this walmart being ghetto they are inconsistent;;;;
4650;they charged about 15/16 dollars more on my oil changed;;;;
4651;came here for lunch;;;;
4652;it's  16;;;;
4653;99 per person and that includes drinks;;;;
4654;huge selection flavorful and not your typical buffet;;;;
4655;great place!;;;;
4656;scheduled a spa day for ourselves while we were on vacation beautiful cozy robes access to steam room sauna and jacuzzi enjoyed a hot stone massage with aromatherapy and foot soak from beginning to end so wonderfully relaxing able to also use a nice shower to finish my visit highly recommended;;;;
4657;they always greet everyone with a smile who enters even when super busy;;;;
4658;they have excellent customer service and i never had any problems coming to this store;;;;
4659;i  highly recommend them and go see mitch who will go above and beyond;;;;
4660;terrible gym the ceiling in the mens shower room is falling apart sauna has not worked properly for 6 months change rooms are freezing cold in the winter and the management could care less;;;;
4661;stay away from this good life;;;;
4662;they don't deserve any stars!;;;;
4663;i am from out of state and my check engine light comes on and i have to get back on the road today;;;;
4664;no i don't have an appt;;;;
4665;it's not like i know i need to get an oil change;;;;
4666;mazda;;;;
4667;sorry i can try to work you in but it's not fair to the other customers;;;;
4668;how about appeasing the customer that is about to get on the road just to find out what's wrong and if i can safely drive home?  i didn't know my check engine light was going to come on;;;;
4669;i understand about appt's but gee you can't just see what the issue may be and if i can drive it;;;;
4670;the venetian is a beautiful hotel! so many cool and fun things to see or do! i got a suite and the room was huge! the only reason for the 4 is because the room service food was not too great and there were some items left from the previous guests in the room which tells me that room service does not do a thorough job;;;;
4671;after agonizing over where to have our one upscale meal in montreal we decided on chez l'epicier;;;;
4672;we were glad we did;;;;
4673;"we did the tasting menu will wine pairings (note that 2 courses do not come paired) and our ""journey"" included a savory macaroon amuse bouche gazpacho gnocci cod goose foix gras and more";;;;
4674;the tastes were small but hearty most with a delicious inventive sauce;;;;
4675;the wines were great and ran the gamut of classic french wines and were well paired;;;;
4676;the service was perfectly paced with our server prepping our next course and pouring wine and another server serving and explaining each dish;;;;
4677;we were able to get a same day reservation on a monday night;;;;
4678;the space was about 3/4 full and the meal took 2;;;;
4679;5 hours due to the numerous tastings and relaxed pace;;;;
4680;the decor is modern chic and there is a bar area to do bites/drinks;;;;
4681;dress code - you will not feel out of place if you aren't in a jacket - but i'd recommend making this your dress up night;;;;
4682;i was very surprised and happy about finding this store;;;;
4683;it didn't seem so promising from the outside but they have the best selection of dresses and awesome service! they definitely know their business and were very helpful in my quest to find the perfect dress!;;;;
4684;9 months later;;;;
4685;and 3 days prior to my wedding i went to the final fitting just to discover that the seamstress' alteration made the dress too tight;;;;
4686;something that was supposed to be a very simple fix ended up messing my dress with only 2 days left which means not enough time to fix anything;;;;
4687;the customer service is only good when the manager is there;;;;
4688;the other ladies aren't really helpful and i definitely had a very low opinion about this store;;;;
4689;the selection of dresses they carry is very good and the service is amazing while they are getting your business;;;;
4690;the follow ups and fittings/alterations can only be booked monday to thursday and the customer service experience is quite bad;;;;
4691;i have been to chuchai 5 times now;;;;
4692;trust me on this get the sticky rice and the crispy duck! i would have given them 5 stars but the last time i was there the food arrived cold and we asked them to reheat it;;;;
4693;it came back to the table just as cold the second time;;;;
4694;the patio is a great people-watching spot in the summer plus it's bring your own wine which helps keep the cost down seeing as it is a tad overpriced;;;;
4695;i love this place;;;;
4696;i admit i am stuck on the old fashioned turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce;;;;
4697;this is real fresh roast turkey (i think roasted daily but not sure) on great wheat bread the sauce has just a bit of a bite and compliments the sandwich well;;;;
4698;huge helping of turkey;;;;
4699;the setting is in an old pecan grove with mature trees and grass;;;;
4700;a very relaxed kind of place to just enjoy the phoenix weather the food and those you are with;;;;
4701;it closes during the summer and i can't wait for it to open back up in the fall;;;;
4702;the perfect ending however are the deserts;;;;
4703;they are all hommade and terrific;;;;
4704;i can't get past the pecan pie perhaps the best in phoenix;;;;
4705;the crust is just right flaky and it's loaded with pecans;;;;
4706;i'm hungry again just writing this review;;;;
4707;i love savers - the deals are great and the staff is positive;;;;
4708;there is good quality and you don't see much of anything with stains etc;;;;
4709;on them;;;;
4710;everyone has a great attitude and it's clean;;;;
4711;we made a special trip to vegas this past weekend from la and hit all local savers including the one in henderson;;;;
4712;almost $600 later i am now dealing with adhesive for four pair of boots and 10 pairs of shoes!;;;;
4713;while savers deserves five stars the adhesive on the back of the price tags is very hard to remove and the frustration level is palpable;;;;
4714;when they put it on the inside of the shoe bottom and you try to remove it it leaves a gooey residue that is all but fun when you slip on a pair of shoes in warm weather and your foot is sweaty;;;;
4715;ignoring the schmuck sound when you lift up your foot to walk due to it sticking to the shoe it doesn't feel very good;;;;
4716;you can put these price tags directly on leather and they don't stick because leather breathes;;;;
4717;"it's the synthetic material they use for the inside of shoes where adhesive really only does ""its thing"" leading to frustration";;;;
4718;i still love your stores anyway but this would be a great help and not so frustrating!;;;;
4719;it's not a hilton but clean comfortable and safe;;;;
4720;we choose to stay here simply because it was close to our client's office and because every other hotel doubled their rates due to spring training by baseball teams;;;;
4721;it looks much better on the inside than the outside as at first we were a little concerned;;;;
4722;however the place has tight security and large balconies;;;;
4723;we stayed there for several days and found the motel to be exceptionally clean the owners/operators were very friendly;;;;
4724;the rooms where comfortable we had a balcony;;;;
4725;no chairs to sit outside however - bring the ones out from the room;;;;
4726;great water pressure and close to downtown where we could walk to restaurants and not have to pay for parking;;;;
4727;older tv's but good selection of cable tv microwave and small frig;;;;
4728;the internet is free and very high speed so that was an added bonus;;;;
4729;for the price range you can't beat it;;;;
4730;i would stay there again as it was one of the best no-frills motels i've been in;;;;
4731;two blocks away are the high priced hotels so we were happy we could save a few bucks;;;;
4732;i don't normally like to do this but i have to after the terrible experience i just had;;;;
4733;centurylink has the worst customer service i've ever experienced;;;;
4734;two weeks ago i put in my order and the tech was scheduled to come in yesterday;;;;
4735;nobody showed up and nobody called to reschedule;;;;
4736;today i called was on the phone for almost two hours transferred to four people and was told they had to reschedule for thursday there was nothing they could do to help me earlier;;;;
4737;"i even talked to a supervisor who was the worst ""supervisor"" i've ever dealt with";;;;
4738;two hours later and i now have to wait until thursday;;;;
4739;nobody apologized nobody seemed to care;;;;
4740;i told them if they don't come thursday i'll be cancelling my service and going with cox;;;;
4741;also this whole time i was on their site talking with a live customer service rep online trying to figure this out but all they told me was they couldn't do anything;;;;
4742;so today's worst company award goes to centurylink;;;;
4743;it was a lonely cold evening and the roads were slick from the rain that was pouring down;;;;
4744;not!;;;;
4745;actually to tell you the truth it was a bright hot & sunny day [like usual in vegas] and my great aunt and uncle were visiting;;;;
4746;needed a quick and close restaurant to grub at;;;;
4747;mexican food sounded good;;;;
4748;hey look its viva mercados!;;;;
4749;[my aunt] so you've been there?!;;;;
4750;[me] no;;;;
4751;but lets try it;;;;
4752;walking in the decor was the usual;;;;
4753;whats the word;;;;
4754;oh yes;;;;
4755;festive;;;;
4756;but then again thats what you find at every mexican restaurant;;;;
4757;the hostess sat us quickly;;;;
4758;1 star for that;;;;
4759;lets just state;;;;
4760;i hate waiting;;;;
4761;especially if the place isn't busy;;;;
4762;quick friendly service;;;;
4763;lady explained to us the specials and what different words meant that i hadn't heard before;;;;
4764;add 1 more star;;;;
4765;didn't try the chips salsa or bean dip;;;;
4766;i'm just not one to fill up on that stuff then take two bites of my food;;;;
4767;no i wanted to have a empty stomach for my meal so that i could write about my experience;;;;
4768;[yes i know im just brilliant no need for the pat on the back];;;;
4769;the food came and it was hot;;;;
4770;it was delicious mostly cause i was starving;;;;
4771;but it wasn't something that was spectacular;;;;
4772;my mother in law makes better beans and rice;;;;
4773;the taco cracked as soon as i took a bite;;;;
4774;thats another pet peeve;;;;
4775;inside i cried a little;;;;
4776;now all the meat cheese and lettuce was going to fall out;;;;
4777;well that ruined my taco experience;;;;
4778;boo;;;;
4779;the chile relleno was delish;;;;
4780;cooked to perfections and de-seeded just the way i like it;;;;
4781;adding 1 more star just for the chile relleno;;;;
4782;overall it was good;;;;
4783;would have given it another star but this place is way over priced;;;;
4784;can we say expensive;;;;
4785;especially because this place isn't on the strip;;;;
4786;their prices are the same as gonzalez y gonzalez and they're portions aren't as big or as good;;;;
4787;sorry viva mercados i will not be coming back;;;;
4788;worst starbucks ever!!!! the wait time is always crazy here no matter what time they only have one person working they are always out of the baked goods in particular the cake pops is what i like;;;;
4789;so would not suggest this starbucks to stop into;;;;
4790;unless you have absolutely nothing to do and nowhere to be because you will be waiting;;;;
4791;food was ok;;;;
4792;nothing special;;;;
4793;its tastes like frozen food;;;;
4794;i had the chicken breast over veggies and my son had a southwest wrap;;;;
4795;i think the best part was the sauces they use;;;;
4796;the smoothie is just some concentrated mix no real fruit;;;;
4797;not my cup o tea;;;;
4798;this is a family ran joint;;;;
4799;which is fine but how i found out it was family owned and operated was not fine;;;;
4800;"scene- husband and wife arguing about daily duties and how they cant keep doing ""this"" every day";;;;
4801;along with the wife grilling (no pun intended) her daughter about letting the dog out homework and so on;;;;
4802;i wasn't eves dropping they were standing 10 feet away from my table;;;;
4803;it was hard not to hear;;;;
4804;leave that stuff at home;;;;
4805;nobody wants to hear it;;;;
4806;the good stuff first;;;;
4807;nice dã©cor great samosas and chutneys;;;;
4808;great chicken tikka masala (sp?);;;;
4809;the bad;;;;
4810;the awful shrimp dish;;;;
4811;spiced just right but the shrimp was overcooked;;;;
4812;how much;;;;
4813;obviously reheated or held too long;;;;
4814;like biting into a whole water chestnut;;;;
4815;i should have sent the dish back;;;;
4816;did mention it too the waiter;;;;
4817;oh i will tell the chef;;;;
4818;no response at all from management;;;;
4819;were busy bs;;;;
4820;ing at the bar;;;;
4821;lesson learned by me;;;;
4822;just return the 'bloody' dish;;;;
4823;just hate doing that though;;;;
4824;would i go back;;;;
4825;yes definitely;;;;
4826;i admit that i haven't tried all the italian restaurants in toronto;;;;
4827;but of the ones that i have tried ciao has been the place that i've gone to multiple times;;;;
4828;why? let me count the ways;;;;
4829;reserved table is always ready;;;;
4830;amazing service;;;;
4831;fabulous wine selection;;;;
4832;the patio feels so european in the summer;;;;
4833;the portions are huge!;;;;
4834;the quality and taste of the food is amaze;;;;
4835;it's in yorkville - the perfect locale for a quaint after dinner walk;;;;
4836;the olives with the bread - delish!;;;;
4837;i feel like there's probably a lot more reasons - but i also feel like this is enough to make you want to check it out for yourself!;;;;
4838;be sure to order the mushroom risotto - it's divine!!;;;;
4839;oph all over this country is amazing;;;;
4840;i've enjoyed them in minneapolis chicago la and seattle;;;;
4841;i cannot believe how bad this location is and i hate that this is the only location in the valley of the sun;;;;
4842;please;;;;
4843;someone;;;;
4844;open another franchise somewhere else in this valley;;;;
4845;please!;;;;
4846;she is a wonderful person and talented piercer!! awesome job and very professional;;;;
4847;highly recommended;;;;
4848;this place is definitely a local spot;;;;
4849;we stumbled in on friday around 7pm to a karaoke night! everyone seemed to know one another and felt like family (some may have actually been family;;;;
4850;it was so intimate they even celebrated the monthly birthdays and sang to a woman with a birthday crown on;;;;
4851;definitely felt like a regular karaoke group that returns each week;;;;
4852;everyone welcomed us even new people that came in said hello and told us about the karaoke nights and to come back again soon;;;;
4853;despite the closeness of the patrons we didn't feel like an outsider;;;;
4854;food;;;;
4855;you go and order at the counter and then sit and they will bring it to you;;;;
4856;the woman at the counter was very friendly and helped us making our decisions;;;;
4857;they have a wide variety of items including ice cream coffee desserts salads sandwiches breakfast tea etc;;;;
4858;very reasonably priced menu! i got the tuna melt it was just ok;;;;
4859;the tuna salad was a bit too over dressed for my liking;;;;
4860;it felt gluttonous with all the mayonnaise and i think there was mustard in there maybe? it came with a side and i chose coleslaw it felt kind of like the kind you would buy in a big jar at sam's club not my favorite but others like their sides so maybe i'll try something else next time;;;;
4861;the others liked the chips and the macaroni salad;;;;
4862;chicken salad on the croissant had similar opinions on the tuna that it was thick and over dressed but the croissant was toasted and good;;;;
4863;i would definitely check this place out again maybe for breakfast next time! i love that they do reward cards for locals to earn free sandwiches and even deliver within a 5 mile radius;;;;
4864;i'll update after my next visit;;;;
4865;hands down the best place to eat in vegas! the food is priced well and the food is delicious! i would have eaten here everyday if i'd known this place was here! my wife absolutely loves this place as well;;;;
4866;service was awesome which is s bonus!;;;;
4867;good prices here huge pancakes available;;;;
4868;"the place is a bit ""breakfast diner""ish which is fine since it is a breakfast diner";;;;
4869;my only probelm is that our server seemed a little impatient;;;;
4870;the service was fine but could use a little more friendliness;;;;
4871;anyways this place is nothing special;;;;
4872;but if you're in the area try it out and you'll get exactly what you expect when you're walking in;;;;
4873;no big surprises here;;;;
4874;derek;;;;
4875;i was skeptical about all these great reviews;;;;
4876;after taking my car into the shop i won't take my car anywhere else in the phoenix area;;;;
4877;crawford's auto repair was extremely thorough;;;;
4878;they pinpointed a noise to three contributing factors;;;;
4879;a rock in the tire a roof rack bolt and something in the sun roof;;;;
4880;i love how detail-oriented these guys are;;;;
4881;they gave me a list of recommended repairs;;;;
4882;not once did they push;;;;
4883;overall the experience was great;;;;
4884;i found it easy to schedule an appointment;;;;
4885;i respected the fact that they honored their estimated time frames;;;;
4886;i love how communicative they were;;;;
4887;highly recommended!;;;;
4888;i won't go back;;;;
4889;food was at best mediocre in flavor and texture;;;;
4890;if i ate the shrimp blindfolded i wouldn't have been able to tell you it was shrimp;;;;
4891;this place used to have great chinese food but apparently not any more;;;;
4892;it's good;;;;
4893;the rolls are better than the sashimi although one time we had some really nice(and surprising) maguro;;;;
4894;we always get the hamachi jalapeã±o roll and some sashimi so don't get me wrong when i say the rolls are better than the sashimi;;;;
4895;it's still enjoyable;;;;
4896;good atmosphere and my girl likes the martinis;;;;
4897;little tokyo in mt;;;;
4898;lebanon and kiku in station square are better;;;;
4899;nakama is good for some enjoyable sushi and more importantly the atmosphere;;;;
4900;you can go here and watch the pens game and eat a roll;;;;
4901;can't say that about a lot of sushi restaurants;;;;
4902;5 of 10 relative to sushi quality alone;;;;
4903;very rude staff;;;;
4904;slow little to no communication between the team;;;;
4905;very grumpy short responses from multiple staff;;;;
4906;then they kept getting orders wrong and had the nerve to argue with a lady about it;;;;
4907;causing the line to go slower;;;;
4908;don't argue make it right;;;;
4909;starbucks nyny was very disappointing today;;;;
4910;wouldn't recommend coming back to this one;;;;
4911;this is a hidden gem  the decor is a bit dated but the pizza is awesome;;;;
4912;i'm from chicago were pizza is king and pizzafarros is my favorite in scottsdale!!!;;;;
4913;reservation = walk in;;;;
4914;pointless to make reservations;;;;
4915;we made a reservation the day before for 11;;;;
4916;00am the next day morning;;;;
4917;when we arrived we are not being served but was asked to wait;;;;
4918;this is  pointless for reservation as at the same time they still take walk in and people who has reservation is under the same queue with the walk in;;;;
4919;"after 30min we asked how much longer will be the wait? the lady answered ""no idea i don't know""";;;;
4920;avoid this restaurant;;;;
4921;an amazing collection of incenses;;;;
4922;the salesman was really kind and had a very good knowledge about the incenses;;;;
4923;he helped me choose the sandalwood i was looking for and he gave me some extra sticks for free;;;;
4924;i'll definitely go back next time visiting toronto;;;;
4925;the first & most important thing you need to know is this place is not family friendly leave the kids at home because they are certainly not welcomed;;;;
4926;they're allowed inside but make sure they leave any kind of expression of joy at the door before entering;;;;
4927;second thing to know indoor voices only;;;;
4928;whispered excitement guarantees you won't be asked to leave;;;;
4929;"yes it's a pinball arcade but it's a ""museum"" pinball hall of fame";;;;
4930;third & last thing (i think) to know is not to expect favorable employee characteristics;;;;
4931;at least not from the guy with the gray ponytail;;;;
4932;especially not from him actually maybe just avoid all contact with him if possible;;;;
4933;once you understand those 3 essential things you are sure to enjoy your time;;;;
4934;with rows of pinball machines there is plenty to check out the variety is not lacking;;;;
4935;you can certainly stretch $10-20 into a good couple hours worth of play;;;;
4936;duck hunt is the biggest tease;;;;
4937;never in working order when i'm there;;;;
4938;don't expect to order sweet and sour anything;;;;
4939;this place is a bit more authentic than the average canuck might like;;;;
4940;it's also tucked away off davis drive and off harry walker so the only way to find it is to look behind the hotel;;;;
4941;the noodle dishes are great and the pad thai is less sweet and more interesting than usual;;;;
4942;portions can be a bit on the small side but so is the dining room;;;;
4943;i have been back a few times so far and this won't be the last time;;;;
4944;it has room to grow on me and so does the rating;;;;
4945;let me be clear;;;;
4946;this food tastes much better than mandarin but is less mainstream than the late chitose;;;;
4947;"newmarket is so desolate in the ""good chinese food"" category that cambodian noodle king is my go to when i can't justify a drive to markham";;;;
4948;i come here weekly to volunteer for the backpack program;;;;
4949;"if you're not aware of this program three square provides ""backpacks"" of food for hungry kids that are enrolled in the school lunch program in order to give them food for the weekends";;;;
4950;it is a really great program and they serve approximately 7000 kids in multiple schools and counties in nevada;;;;
4951;while i admit the backpacks are mostly full of stuff i'd never eat or give my kids (chocolate milk frosted flakes vienna sausage etc) i still think it is a worthwhile program and i'm proud to be one of the people that helps stuff the packs with food and gets them out to hungry kids;;;;
4952;my first time visiting sabor today and all i can say is what an absolute spectacular culinary experience! their latin street food was fresh and very very tasty;;;;
4953;the empanadas were perfectly cooked and juicy not dry at all;;;;
4954;the street corn which is a favorite of mine was the best i have had so far;;;;
4955;i can highly recommend their shrimp and steak tacos which were soft and had great flavor;;;;
4956;we ordered sliced avocado creamy cold quacamole and together with the rosa sauce and fresh lime on the side made for a meal levels above what we paid for or expected;;;;
4957;i love that you have so many choices to choose from to make up a meal that will satisfy any food cravings or preferences you might have and it is fresh and clean;;;;
4958;on top of this the staff is friendly and very helpful;;;;
4959;such a joy! my kids loved this perfect little addition to davidson as well and i can definitely see us becoming regulars;;;;
4960;the tonkatsu ramen with black garlic oil nori and extra tamago is amazing;;;;
4961;definitely add the black garlic oil it's a must! everything here is prepared fresh and from scratch;;;;
4962;it's definitely worth coming back to;;;;
4963;customer service is excellent and we truly loved our experience;;;;
4964;the chefs are super helpful and they really care about their customers;;;;
4965;it's a simple place with a small menu but their ramen is delicious;;;;
4966;the noodles are freshly made as well as their pork;;;;
4967;the soft boiled egg is perfectly made and isn't overly seasoned;;;;
4968;i would recommend coming here;;;;
4969;ok my first yelp review so bear with me;;;;
4970;i tend to break things down into categories so i'll go with that for now;;;;
4971;atmosphere;;;;
4972;confusing;;;;
4973;decor is kinda kitschy supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order;;;;
4974;yeah if you have really loud obnoxious relatives;;;;
4975;maybe it's due to the construction of the space but the place was loud! for the price (more about that later) this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us but i wouldn't recommend it for an romantic/intimate one;;;;
4976;service;;;;
4977;no complaints here;;;;
4978;our server (eric i believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful;;;;
4979;he took the time to explain some of the menu items checked on us fairly often and  was generally very friendly;;;;
4980;high marks here;;;;
4981;food (quality);;;;
4982;again very few complaints;;;;
4983;food was fresh and flavorful;;;;
4984;portions while not huge were pretty satisfying;;;;
4985;my wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much;;;;
4986;i started with the caesar;;;;
4987;the black garlic dressing was delicious! highly recommended!  my wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented;;;;
4988;i had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased;;;;
4989;moist tasty and the mac & cheese was excellent;;;;
4990;topped off with the brookie for dessert a very nice meal;;;;
4991;food (value);;;;
4992;and here's why i tend to shun trendy restaurants;;;;
4993;a cocktail a glass of wine a beer 2 salads 2 entrees and 1 dessert;;;;
4994;just this side of $140;;;;
4995;brief breakdown;;;;
4996;"the beer although a john smith from england was served out of a can! some may call this ""ironic""";;;;
4997;"i say ""tacky!"" the aforementioned beet salad? a few pieces of beet a little arugula a dollop of ricotta";;;;
4998;$14! and although my chicken was very good one medium-sized chicken breast doesn't warrant a price over $20;;;;
4999;"and before the summerlin crowd starts chanting ""go back to denny's"" i'm talking value not price";;;;
5000;my last two steakhouse meals (silverado and circus circus) were each about $30 less for a comparable meal;;;;
5001;so all in all good not great and not worth the price;;;;
5002;ok this place had us right from the start;;;;
5003;my wife just finished  running a marathon and was extremely cold;;;;
5004;seeing her shiver our waiter brought her a cup of homemade chicken vegetable soup on the house;;;;
5005;who does that these days?;;;;
5006;the service really was great;;;;
5007;from start to finish;;;;
5008;the food was excellent;;;;
5009;it was standard fare for a grill but you can tell those that prepared it really cared;;;;
5010;i had the la wrap and my wife had more soup;;;;
5011;both were really good;;;;
5012;they make fresh homemade soup every day;;;;
5013;i'll be back;;;;
5014;you should give them a try too;;;;
5015;great atmosphere;;;;
5016;you can dance or you can just hang out;;;;
5017;plenty of people having fun but not to the point where it is impossible to move around the place;;;;
5018;i would go again;;;;
5019;the service is always sweet nothing too spectacular happening with the food;;;;
5020;they do make the place very cheery and comforting which isn't easy for the space they're working with;;;;
5021;it's a good casual spot for drinks and munchies in a cute neighborhood but nothing to write home about on a normal day;;;;
5022;the coffee i had was pretty gross;;;;
5023;the cappuccino was barely foamy and the coffee was kind of rancidly bitter;;;;
5024;i've been here 10+ times now and each time the service has been excellent;;;;
5025;they have slowed down a little since the grand opening like most places do which to me has only allowed them to improve;;;;
5026;i will continue to frequent this convenient location;;;;
5027;the quality of the food is still great and there's nothing hidden about how it's prepared;;;;
5028;while you wait in line to order you can view openly where they prepare the food so you know it's clean and up to standards;;;;
5029;no complaints here!;;;;
5030;frybread is good but there isn't enough substance;;;;
5031;i got some watered down beans hardly any ground beef and mostly lettuce;;;;
5032;i've never had a bad experience here;;;;
5033;delivery pickup whatever the food always turns out good for me;;;;
5034;yesterday they were my saving grace when papa john's let me down severely;;;;
5035;pizza hut quoted me an hour-ish wait time (which is fine when i know about it not when i'm promised 30-40 minutes and it ends up being over an hour like pj's was);;;;
5036;and they were there at my house with my piping hot delicous pizza in about 25 minutes;;;;
5037;love;;;;
5038;yes this is as good as it gets!  dr;;;;
5039;dameron and his team make going to the dentist actually a really good experience!  the whole staff is very professional kind and accommodating;;;;
5040;not to mention happy!  the hygienists are just the best as are all the staff;;;;
5041;dameron's work is beautifully done and my teeth have never looked or felt better;;;;
5042;i highly recommend this whole office to anyone needing work done!  you will not be disappointed;;;;
5043;i've had 3 other laser tattoo removals before i came here so i know what i should be getting;;;;
5044;honestly she didn't even go over it all the way with the laser;;;;
5045;there's quite a bit of the tattoo that's untouched;;;;
5046;i'll be going somewhere else for the remainder;;;;
5047;it's not worth the pain if it's not even going to make a difference;;;;
5048;i was very pleased with my visit yesterday the staff was friendly and got my drink out fast i wasn't sure what i wanted but i was helped by a young lady named bella and she really took the time to listen and know what i wanted;;;;
5049;she even continued to talk with me after i bought my coffee the employees really did make my day;;;;
5050;i will continue to come back to this location;;;;
5051;i will say that the unsalted edemame was not expected or appreciated;;;;
5052;a friend who lived in japan says unsalted is the default but isn't the way i prefer;;;;
5053;the crab legs were not great either but crab legs are not what brought me to this buffet it was the opportunity to eat an irresponsible amount of sushi and then be able to complain about it on the internet if they asked me to exercise even a bit of discretion;;;;
5054;they did not interrupt my my unrestrained gluttony;;;;
5055;i appreciated this at the time but i wonder how they sleep at night watching gastronomic self destruction shift after shift;;;;
5056;i thought the sushi was pretty good;;;;
5057;i went in the afternoon (paying dinner buffet price) on the weekend;;;;
5058;the selection was pretty good and every time i returned there was more stuff;;;;
5059;it really surprised me that they had sashimi which was well cut;;;;
5060;they had a good variety of sashimi and only one was strong (but i dont remember;;;;
5061;maybe the hamachi?);;;;
5062;the rolls were rolled well too;;;;
5063;as for freshness only what i think was the hamachi was maybe off;;;;
5064;i am sure it depends on when you go;;;;
5065;i tipped the guys working the buffet (as well as my server) because i thought they were good enough to warrant it;;;;
5066;the service was friendly;;;;
5067;i thought it was weird that drinks come in massive beer steins which do not exactly mesh with the contemporary asian fusion decor which is classy and understated;;;;
5068;there was a group there (i think it was somebody's birthday or engagement or something) and it was clear that this is a good place for a group of people to go;;;;
5069;if you want to eat a lot of sushi or want to go to a restaurant with a variety of asian dishes plus a lot of sushi that is not expensive this is a good choice;;;;
5070;i wish it wasn't in bumblefuck south kankakee and i hope that the location doesn't deep-six the place but i will be back;;;;
5071;the square plays host to so many things throughout the warm weather months it's a staple for those living right downtown;;;;
5072;my favourite thing about it is the fountains in the summer and the free movie nights at sunset (byochair);;;;
5073;but sometimes the square is best when there is nothing going on and instead it's a big empty space available for a time out away from the crowds right across the way at the eaton centre;;;;
5074;i'm very surprised that after 20+ reviews this place has a 4 1/2 average rating;;;;
5075;first off so you don't think i'm some elitist bastard let me state that i happily eat food at ihop and denny's;;;;
5076;anyway so as i was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in vegas apparently eating at the peppermill was a must?!? the decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between denny's and a strip club;;;;
5077;i don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club;;;;
5078;service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse);;;;
5079;so why 2 stars? well;;;;
5080;the food absolutely sucked;;;;
5081;i ordered a swiss mushroom burger w/curly fries;;;;
5082;first off the burger and curly fries looked delicious;;;;
5083;but upon eating my food;;;;
5084;i found absolutely no taste in any of the food even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it;;;;
5085;it's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food;;;;
5086;plus the mayo i got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right;;;;
5087;anyway the service and price were okay decor a little dirty feeling for my taste;;;;
5088;but what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all;;;;
5089;save your money and go to in & out burger at the other end of the strip or even burger king much closer at o'sheas;;;;
5090;ordered 2 coffee and two breakfast croissant sandwich for me and bf;;;;
5091;the croissant was very tasty but the size is tiny;;;;
5092;so it's quite expensive for the size;;;;
5093;i would like to return but i probably will need to order two just for myself and it would be too expensive for breakfast;;;;
5094;"un genre de ""self serve"" de pã¢tisseries hongkongaises";;;;
5095;les prix sont abordables et en plus c'est vraiment bon! on voit frã©quemment les employã©s remplir les prã©sentoirs de pã¢tisseries fraichement cuites ã§a prouve au moins qu'il y a un bon roulement de produits et qu'ils trainent pas sur les tablettes plusieurs jours;;;;
5096;je n'ai goã»tã© qu'aux pã¢tisseries sucrã©es mais ils en ont aussi pas mal ã  base de viande pour les repas c'est ã  essayer si vous ãªtes curieux!;;;;
5097;located at the venetian hotel in las vegas;;;;
5098;great service fast or slow depending on how busy it is;;;;
5099;i ordered beef/broccoli chicken chow mein soft noodles & a small wonton soup;;;;
5100;i didn't like the green bell pepper in the chow mein (next time i will order without it);;;;
5101;today i ordered a noodle soup with chicken and vegetables;;;;
5102;definitely hit the spot;;;;
5103;i added some soy sauce and chili for flavor;;;;
5104;one of my favorite chinese restaurants';;;;
5105;never had a problem at this one until today;;;;
5106;guess they were to busy to care about the quality of their food;;;;
5107;i ordered my regular asiago ranch spicy chicken sandwich;;;;
5108;got my food at the window i always do a quality check no matter what looked at my sandwich and it had honey mustard on it last time i checked honey mustard and ranch were two different things;;;;
5109;so i sent it back the girl who made it came to the window and argued that it was made correctly;;;;
5110;i said no because asiago ranch isn't yellow and doesn't taste like honey mustard;;;;
5111;she said i know i made it right i said ok well i don't want it;;;;
5112;so she took it back brought me another one this time a regular chicken sandwich with a ranch packet;;;;
5113;yeah i paid 7 dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich;;;;
5114;sweet girl right nasty attitude to boot;;;;
5115;so i took it into the store this time and the manager showed me the ranch in the bottle that was suppose to be on my sandwich and remade it;;;;
5116;wow imagine that someone who new how to make it without attitude;;;;
5117;i'm still very disappointed money is money no matter where you spend it at;;;;
5118;and i expect to get what i ask for with my money;;;;
5119;not something you just feel like free styling;;;;
5120;we had my mother's birthday party here on 10/29/16;;;;
5121;what a great time we all had;;;;
5122;the food music and waiters were great!!! thanks lyles!!!;;;;
5123;wow - this place is incredible;;;;
5124;it is huge well lit organized and everything is used and reasonably priced;;;;
5125;saw this place on yelp and had to check it out;;;;
5126;they advertise as an entertainment exchange store;;;;
5127;they take trades on books magazines movies cds games;;;;
5128;i have never seen a used place this well great;;;;
5129;wish we had something comparable in denver;;;;
5130;i love this place;;;;
5131;it's great to have a neighborhood center with good food and great coffee!!  the patio is great all year long;;;;
5132;shaunz sells the most unique shirts i have ever come across! the staff quality of clothing and selection is incredible;;;;
5133;thank you shaunz for selling shirts online now!;;;;
5134;there are two giant eagles nearby;;;;
5135;the gargantuan market district over in village square and this one;;;;
5136;i would choose this one 9/10 times over the other;;;;
5137;that lone other time is in the event i run out of a special shaving soap that only seems to be sold there;;;;
5138;i don't particularly like giant eagle unless i'm armed with coupons;;;;
5139;they double coupons but their regular prices are high;;;;
5140;but this particular giant eagle had one huge bonus;;;;
5141;their bakery makes really good everything bagels;;;;
5142;better than the ones from the other giant eagle market district even though that bakery is huge and fancy;;;;
5143;even before their renovation i would go there just for bagels;;;;
5144;their donuts are just like other giant eagle bakery donuts;;;;
5145;really good;;;;
5146;personally i prefer them over dunkin;;;;
5147;the store is recently renovated clean and normal in size;;;;
5148;i highly recommend this spa;;;;
5149;asian foot massage spas are a dime a dozen out here but this one was professional clean and overall very pleasant;;;;
5150;this is the place to get your massages! out-of-towners;;;;
5151;take an evening off the main strip and take a cab out to this chinatown strip;;;;
5152;get a foot massage here dinner and tea downstairs and visit the shops on this part of town;;;;
5153;i was treated to lunch here and even for a free lunch it was not satisfying;;;;
5154;first my french onion soup had very little flavor almost watered down;;;;
5155;the cheese was overcooked and clumping and the bread was just;;;;
5156;bread in my soup;;;;
5157;i had the short ribs for my entree;;;;
5158;the ribs where extremely dry and overcooked;;;;
5159;the portions are small and the meat was so inedible that i didn't even finish my meal;;;;
5160;what flavor that was infused was just sauce cooked onto the meat and no flavor from the meat itself;;;;
5161;i was extremely disappointed;;;;
5162;my guess is that they garner the majority of their business from out of towners staying in the hotel it is connected to;;;;
5163;this will definitely not be in my lunch rotation downtown;;;;
5164;i love ny city pizza pie;;;;
5165;excellent rendition of sharing a portion of ny here in the desert;;;;
5166;last time i was in this area at lunch time chao was still being built;;;;
5167;now it's open and today was my first official visit to check things out;;;;
5168;i've only tried one entree from the menu but if the other choices are anything like what i ate today i will definitely be a regular here;;;;
5169;i tried the pad kee mao with chicken;;;;
5170;if you don't know what this is it consists of rice noodles onion thai basil chili a little bell pepper and a slice of tomato in there somewhere - all covered in spicy brown sauce;;;;
5171;the flavor of this entree was amazing - definitely something i will order again;;;;
5172;one of my co-workers decided to eat light and ordered the chicken satay which he also enjoyed;;;;
5173;service here was great - brian took good care of us;;;;
5174;they seem to be doing well since they opened;;;;
5175;decent crowd at lunch but not too packed;;;;
5176;i like the layout inside - and the fact that they have a bar means i will definitely be visiting chao in the near future for happy hour;;;;
5177;updates to follow after i visit here a few more times!;;;;
5178;i appreciate the staff clean facilities and responsiveness to maintenance requests;;;;
5179;i have utlized the gym and access to wi fi in the office with no issues,;;;;
5180;a little pricey but worth it! crepes were delicious! we got the seafood and chicken pesto;;;;
5181;really cute back area and service was good;;;;
5182;would come back!;;;;
5183;i searched for the closest shipping center near me and found safe ship;;;;
5184;to be honest i chose this business primarily because of their high ratings;;;;
5185;i had to ship two extra large packages to hawaii and wanted tracking and arrival signatures but didn't want to pay an arm & leg for it;;;;
5186;ben was of great help and got me the best deal possible with my packages' specific weights and dimensions;;;;
5187;i couldn't be happier with my experience and highly recommend safe ship to anyone!;;;;
5188;my husband brought me here for our 2nd year anniversary and i love the ambience of this place;;;;
5189;that includes the music and environment;;;;
5190;the food was amazing;;;;
5191;we ordered the truffle fries and it was great!!!  i ordered the spicy seafood pasta and my husband ordered the amazing chicken and rice au gratin;;;;
5192;the cocktails were awesome and we had a great night;;;;
5193;the service was fast and the waiter was very pleasant to talk to;;;;
5194;it wasn't pricey either which was a surprise given the amazing service there;;;;
5195;this is a definite go!;;;;
5196;if there are two things i like they are eating and drinking;;;;
5197;and gastropubs really let me do both at the same time very well;;;;
5198;so they're already on a good footing with me;;;;
5199;gaspar is a very nice place inside;;;;
5200;it has a cozy warm feeling with its dim (but not too dim) interior exposed brick and wood;;;;
5201;tip;;;;
5202;you can get in either on rue de la commune or rue saint paul or through the hotel to which it is attached;;;;
5203;both times i came i sat at the bar and received excellent and friendly service;;;;
5204;the first time it was monday evening and it was dead (and late november;;;;
5205;and cold outside);;;;
5206;i had the (bbq bourbon bacon) burger (that's a lot of bs);;;;
5207;while it was cooked more than i'd have liked (i wasn't asked how i wanted it done and didn't think to specify;;;;
5208;stupid me!) it still tasted very good;;;;
5209;cooked a bit less it could be a top 20 burger for me;;;;
5210;i also subbed fries out for cheesy mashed taters (no extra charge) and they were yummy too;;;;
5211;oh and i had a pint of beer which was beery good;;;;
5212;second visit thursday night and the place was much more hopping;;;;
5213;there was live music drink specials and a generally good vibe in the place;;;;
5214;i had steak frites which was cooked to the medium i specified (i was asked this time) and good though not exceptional;;;;
5215;the fries (aka frites) were very good;;;;
5216;the highlight of the meal believe it or not was the pea soup which was so good i almost licked the bowl when i finished! you can bet i'll be ordering that again next time i'm there;;;;
5217;oh and i had a house beer or two ($6/pint);;;;
5218;you can bet i'll be back (probably very soon)!;;;;
5219;great burger;;;;
5220;one of the best fast food burgers i've ever had right behind 5 guys;;;;
5221;i've been a fan of pita jungle since my asu days when i lived down the street from the apache location;;;;
5222;now i live in the arcadia area so this is the one we frequent;;;;
5223;i haven't noticed a huge difference between the two locations same great food same stoned servers;;;;
5224;my usual is the portabello burger;;;;
5225;the balsamic marinade they use is fantastic;;;;
5226;the presentation is a little messy but once it hits your lips it's so good;;;;
5227;i pass on the new potatoes for steamed spinach and it's pretty amazing;;;;
5228;everyone knows the hummus rocks;;;;
5229;i love how they let you split up a small order between the roasted bell pepper and jalapeno cilantro;;;;
5230;it's like a little hummus sampler for less than $5;;;;
5231;the service can be spotty especially when it comes to drink refills but i've surprisingly never had an order come out incorrectly;;;;
5232;i normally would not be surprised by this standard service expectation being consistently fulfilled but i have had some baked servers here so the fact that they can remember my steamed spinach substitution each and every time is kind of impressive;;;;
5233;so good job stoned servers;;;;
5234;maybe work on the drink thing though;;;;
5235;there is nothing bad in here !! it's true;;;;
5236;amazing bagels bakery section i've always loved their sandwiches and there omelets are so good;;;;
5237;i remember they used to be in the sun coast hotel and they had some amazing sugar free desserts;;;;
5238;i don't know if they make them anymore;;;;
5239;sad;;;;
5240;but do go it's so good;;;;
5241;had to come here today because my son wanted falafel balls for dinner(i went to costco walmart nobody carries them;;;;
5242;) i hate the customer service here but love the products;;;;
5243;today at checkout i didn't get a hello but i got a thankyou and a have a nice day;;;;
5244;maybe things are starting to look up here;;;;
5245;it needs to because there is never anybody in this store;;;;
5246;they are probably busy on saturdays;;;;
5247;today they had 3 checkouts open and there was not a queue at any;;;;
5248;we arrived for our reservation at 7;;;;
5249;15pm;;;;
5250;they seated us right on time;;;;
5251;the resturant was fairly loud at first but once the family dinner croed cleared out at 7;;;;
5252;30pm it quieted down;;;;
5253;the food and service was outstanding and at a very reasonable price;;;;
5254;i highly recommend mimi's very a late dinner;;;;
5255;very overpriced for what you get;;;;
5256;i had the skirt steak which was stringy and tough;;;;
5257;i've had much better meals at mad mex;;;;
5258;our server was extremely impersonal and we were rushed out;;;;
5259;will not return;;;;
5260;always slow service;;;;
5261;they don't always have what you initially wanted and then they mess that order up too;;;;
5262;i come  here because of the proximity but i think i'll just make the drive out to a different starbucks from now on;;;;
5263;i agree with some of the other reviewers the coffee is weak and the parking/drive thru  set up is hell;;;;
5264;overall  not worth going to this location;;;;
5265;bang is by far the best chiropractor i've ever been to;;;;
5266;most chiropractors just crack all your joints and call it a day but dr;;;;
5267;bang believes chiropractics is not just about cracking bones;;;;
5268;he finds the movement and alignment through other stimulation's such as heat therapy electricity and a couple other devices;;;;
5269;we actually didn't start adjusting joints until my 4th visit! every session i feel a lot better he runs the facility by himself so when you come in it's a personable experience all around;;;;
5270;highly recommend!;;;;
5271;if you are looking for entertainment from the wait staff save your time and money because you will not get it at this location;;;;
5272;not only did we not have an interactive waitress we did not see any around us;;;;
5273;we love dick's last resort however going to this location was a total let down for our family;;;;
5274;this experience for us was nothing more than a very expensive dinner with no entertainment;;;;
5275;very disappointing;;;;
5276;this restaurant is a gem!  service was spectacular and the food was terrific;;;;
5277;based on yelp review i ordered the traditional greek salad;;;;
5278;absolutely fantastic - light dressing huge size and totally delicious;;;;
5279;i strongly suggest going when they have their live entertainment;;;;
5280;beyond my expectations;;;;
5281;we were treated like valued guests;;;;
5282;try the spanokopita - it's delicious;;;;
5283;belly dancing and live music with incredible singers;;;;
5284;what a delight;;;;
5285;i can see why the packhouse is not a packed house;;;;
5286;(see what i did there?);;;;
5287;i already wasn't really thrilled about coming to this joint;;;;
5288;i checked the reviews they weren't really poppin;;;;
5289;i looked at pics weren't enough of them;;;;
5290;and the menu looked;;;;
5291;okay;;;;
5292;but i'm always down for something new and different and my homie was eager to check this place out so why not?;;;;
5293;welp it wasn't good my friend;;;;
5294;i ordered the packhouse burger;;;;
5295;because if you can't do a burger right then something is seriously wrong;;;;
5296;and it was all wrong;;;;
5297;not once but twice;;;;
5298;my other homie decides to get the same thing;;;;
5299;she didn't want the tomato jam (she's allergic to tomatoes) and she wanted hers cooked medium well;;;;
5300;i wanted the tomato jam and my meat to be cooked medium;;;;
5301;you following so far?;;;;
5302;we both asked for the mac and cheese as a side;;;;
5303;side note;;;;
5304;why do they not have fries???!!! not even sweet potato fries???!! like forreal tho;;;;
5305;anyway they bring out my homies burger and my other friends dish;;;;
5306;they bring out my food last;;;;
5307;there's a ton of mustard on my burger;;;;
5308;literally all i can taste is mustard;;;;
5309;they killed my meat;;;;
5310;like if the cow wasn't dead before they cooked it they made sure they killed it when they grilled it;;;;
5311;and after a few bites i noticed i didn't have any tomato jam;;;;
5312;come to find out they switched me and my homies burgers;;;;
5313;although her meat was well done and dry as well;;;;
5314;my homie is breaking out (tomato allergy) and i'm just over the burger;;;;
5315;they were nice enough to comp our burgers and asked if we wanted new ones;;;;
5316;we were good with that;;;;
5317;they also said they would give us free dessert;;;;
5318;okaaaay!!!;;;;
5319;new burgers come out they get the toppings right and the chef wasn't as enthusiastic with the mustard the second go round;;;;
5320;however! my meat was still dry and over cooked;;;;
5321;{sigh};;;;
5322;whatever;;;;
5323;i couldn't finish the burger;;;;
5324;like the meat was a choking hazard;;;;
5325;the mac and cheese was aight;;;;
5326;i love gouda but it wasn't hittin it;;;;
5327;ah well;;;;
5328;my other homie said her crab cake was too juicy;;;;
5329;i didn't get much else from her meal but she did say this place was 2 star worthy as well;;;;
5330;also we get the complimentary bread and butter after we get our food;;;;
5331;the homie has to ask for the bread and butter;;;;
5332;strange and not needed at that point;;;;
5333;the desserts (forgot to take pics) were actually really good;;;;
5334;the hummingbird cake was moist and not too sweet;;;;
5335;i don't like nuts but i had several bites anyway cause the flavor was really good;;;;
5336;the oatmeal cream pie cookie joint was pretty good but again i'm not a fan of nuts and thick creamy icing;;;;
5337;but anyone who is down for this would love it!;;;;
5338;so there you have it;;;;
5339;the service was top notch;;;;
5340;i gave more than 20% of what my bill would have been because i can't fault the staff but i'm sorry guys the food needs some work;;;;
5341;the location and setup is dope;;;;
5342;the vibe is chill and everyone is really attentive and nice;;;;
5343;if they work on the food i can see this place getting packed with the quickness;;;;
5344;i like to come here every 3-6 months;;;;
5345;i'm not huge on injera so every quarter to half a year is enough to get my fix;;;;
5346;i have loved this place every single time i went except the last;;;;
5347;the (beautiful) waitress is really helpful in helping you choose a dish and (again other than my last visit) they are always delicious;;;;
5348;unfortunately the last time i went the dish she recommended tasted like old chinese food (which is very strange) but i've been probably 10 other times and each time it has been delicious so i'm going to just assume it was a one-off bad day and give it another try because honestly the food is generally really good and filling;;;;
5349;prices are decent they have groupons available for this place a lot so if you are nervous about going wait for a groupon to be available and that should cover half the meal for 2-3 people;;;;
5350;the place is usually pretty packed but on a week night you can usually get a seat without having to wait;;;;
5351;i hate that my review is going to contribute to the growing popularity of this place and me waiting longer to get a table in the future but oh well;;;;
5352;this place has the best beer selection that i've seen in the city;;;;
5353;the variety of beers is unparalleled;;;;
5354;barvolo doesn't touch this barhop! i also like that they let you do samplers of their draft beers;;;;
5355;the food is pretty good too;;;;
5356;really they excel at all the things i've complained that was wrong about barvolo (see my other review);;;;
5357;the beauty salon business does well around this area;;;;
5358;there's many!;;;;
5359;dimple's was no great shakes;;;;
5360;it was conveniently located to where i was running errands and brown (so i knew eyebrow threading would be inexpensive and ace);;;;
5361;eyebrow threading is $4;;;;
5362;that's usually what it goes for at these places;;;;
5363;no taxes on cash payments! i am not being racist but white places charge more and they don't do a great job;;;;
5364;so always find an indian or arab place to go to for threading;;;;
5365;it hurt;;;;
5366;but i came out looking fabulous! #worthit;;;;
5367;listen don't complain that you got in late or the guy at the door was rude if you get there if you get there past 11pm who do you think you are the kardashians?! i mean seriously i get bottle service every single time and i do not get there later than 10-1030 pm sure the club may still be empty but i would muchhh rather hang out at my sickkk table than wait in a line for 2 hours;;;;
5368;amazing club if you have game you willl have fun i highly recommend a table it is keyyy because you get tired of dancing for a few hours you go back to your table with some chicks hang out for a quick 20 then your back at it going nuts!;;;;
5369;oddly enough it was a negative yelp review that drew me to diamond's in the first place (a review i see is no longer on yelp);;;;
5370;but after putting up with crappy service just to get the sourdough burger i love the argument with a man who was either the gm or the owner about whether a service dog could come in his bar was the last straw;;;;
5371;i'm not sure why he thinks he can refuse service to someone coming in with a service dog but that was the last straw for me;;;;
5372;i will miss the sourdough burger but trust me when i suggest you find a nicer place and ask them to make a sourdough burger (on sourdough bread with grilled onions and cheese);;;;
5373;this hawaiian/korean restaurant brought me back to the local cuisine of  hawaii;;;;
5374;i ordered the meat jun combo plate and it was good;;;;
5375;the soy dipping sauce for the meat jun should be bottled and sold in markets;;;;
5376;deifinitely stopping by to try the other items on the menu;;;;
5377;the aloha spirit is deifinitely alive and well in las vegas;;;;
5378;thanks to russel;;;;
5379;i just got the apple fritter;;;;
5380;i wanted to love it so much;;;;
5381;the texture was nice the apple chunks were perfect;;;;
5382;however;;;;
5383;it was so greasy i lost all the good flavor to grease;;;;
5384;i am honestly disappointed and not satisfied at all;;;;
5385;they were very nice and even warmed my one lowly apple fritter up;;;;
5386;i just wish it were less greasy;;;;
5387;i love salad and go! healthy delicious food on the fly;;;;
5388;the best drive-through in surprise! very friendly staff & fast service;;;;
5389;have loved every single thing i've tried off the menu!;;;;
5390;when looking up hotels to stay in i was skeptical about this and many other hotels as one usually is in a city the've never visited;;;;
5391;however i was extremely pleased with my stay at platinum;;;;
5392;location;;;;
5393;located next to an am/pm gas station;;;;
5394;this was great because i could pregame on the cheap before we went to various places;;;;
5395;the hotel is very visible but still in the cut;;;;
5396;about a half mile or so from the venetian;;;;
5397;customer service;;;;
5398;when i walked in i was greeted with warmth;;;;
5399;it was about 1 am so not many people were in the lobby;;;;
5400;which was actually the case throughout my entire trip;;;;
5401;i chatted with the front desk associate like we were old friends;;;;
5402;he was just that nice;;;;
5403;and he made me feel so welcome!;;;;
5404;room;;;;
5405;can i tell you that this room was everything in life?! ok;;;;
5406;there i told you;;;;
5407;i was in room 402 i believe;;;;
5408;this room was in fact a suite;;;;
5409;i felt like it was an apartment and i had a lease;;;;
5410;freaking huge! it had separate areas for a kitchen (complete with full fridge stove / oven microwave dishwasher and bar) living room balcony bedroom with 2 queen beds a safe closet and tv and bathroom with closet garden tub separate bathroom and double sink vanity;;;;
5411;the bathroom was the size of most rooms;;;;
5412;completely clean!!!!;;;;
5413;i stayed in it by myself;;;;
5414;what a wondrous time!!!!!!! i had everything i needed and then some;;;;
5415;and the view! perfect view of the strip;;;;
5416;it's the perfect way to be a part of vegas without all the noise and smoke you get in a hotel with a casino;;;;
5417;at half the price;;;;
5418;or less depending on when you go;;;;
5419;my first night in vegas was spent relaxing in my beautiful room;;;;
5420;tip;;;;
5421;even if you can't go get a full massage or service at the spa at least purchase a cupcake bath salt from them and use in that beautiful tub;;;;
5422;so relaxing!;;;;
5423;i will def be bringing my sister and cousin back this march! can't wait!;;;;
5424;im sure i left something out but you get the gist right? if not;;;;
5425;stay here!! you won't regret it!;;;;
5426;i have been eating sushi a long time;;;;
5427;this place was so wonderful;;;;
5428;great sushi! i strongly recommend eating here;;;;
5429;enjoy;;;;
5430;stopped here for lunch after our dam tour based on yelp reviews;;;;
5431;we were starving and this place hit the spot;;;;
5432;do yourself a favor and get the cheese sticks!  yum!  girlfriends had the bacon burger and said it was top notch;;;;
5433;i had the bbq chicken salad and it was also very good;;;;
5434;service was good too;;;;
5435;all in all 6 thumbs up from the 3 of us!;;;;
5436;great place;;;;
5437;we stayed at the hermosa inn and dinner and breakfast at lon's were included as part of our package;;;;
5438;we were warmly greeted by the gentleman who was the host upon entering;;;;
5439;dinner was fantastic - the strip steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful;;;;
5440;started with the tortilla soup and finished with the panna cotta;;;;
5441;but our favorite part of the meal was the side of truffle fries - wow!  thought it was great that they had local beer options from mcfate brewing on tap - rare to find them on tap around the valley outside of the brewery;;;;
5442;our server was very pleasant and helpful and my wife got a birthday card from the staff since it was her birthday;;;;
5443;we returned for breakfast the next day;;;;
5444;breakfast menu was considerably smaller and a lot less options but the food was really good;;;;
5445;i had the ham & cheese omelette which was great;;;;
5446;large portion of toast accompanied my omelette and the crispy potatoes that came with the omelette were really good;;;;
5447;overall a really great experience - wouldn't hesitate to return for an upscale meal;;;;
5448;i've been to sakana twice for lunch and both times have been happy with the sushi and service;;;;
5449;instead of creating longer rolls with more pieces of sushi they create shorter fatter rolls;;;;
5450;makes for a bigger piece of sushi which i'm ok with;;;;
5451;i'd say the quality of fish rice and seaweed is good to very good;;;;
5452;i had 3 rolls and walked away full and content;;;;
5453;it's not the very best sushi i've ever had but it's a great choice here in scottsdale;;;;
5454;if you're in the area and are looking for a good sushi restaurant i'd recommend you try sakana out;;;;
5455;there is absolutely no point in coming here if you come late or do not have a daybed;;;;
5456;you won't have anywhere to put your stuff which is a nuisance;;;;
5457;there is bag check but the lines are long;;;;
5458;plus sometimes you don't want to stand the entire time in the pool after standing in the long lines in the sun;;;;
5459;i saw a girl get hooked up to an iv and taken out on a wheelchair;;;;
5460;stay classy vegas;;;;
5461;also;;;;
5462;the water gets murky after a while;;;;
5463;do you really want to go in there?  you would be putting yourself at risk for foot fungus or stds;;;;
5464;if you do decide to go here you can go in with full-fledged self-confidence because people will flaunt their stretch marks cellulite and other goodies;;;;
5465;this place is gross;;;;
5466;it was understaffed;;;;
5467;i was given a super dry day old chicken in my ceasar salad;;;;
5468;the water made me sick;;;;
5469;i am hoping a truly do not have food poisoning but definitely feel sick to my stomach after eating here;;;;
5470;i will not eat here again;;;;
5471;fastening vibe and vegas strip friendly;;;;
5472;staff takes care considerably and is very current;;;;
5473;love the scenery! thank you azuza staff;;;;
5474;xoxo ace encore;;;;
5475;this is my second visit;;;;
5476;my first was back during ces in jan;;;;
5477;with a young friend visiting vegas for the first time and who had never had a bloody mary;;;;
5478;service was very good the large bloody mary was impressive and the jack daniel's chocolate cake was to die for;;;;
5479;i liked it enough to want to go again;;;;
5480;except for the big bloody mary meal - slim jim pickles cheese cubes peppers  candied bacon !!!!;;;;
5481;sausage;;;;
5482;red onion (see pics only large u6 shrimp were missing;;;;
5483;) everything else was a disappointment;;;;
5484;service was very strange - the smiles were abundant but everything else about the service was off from how scarce our server was to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast;;;;
5485;to how long it took to place our orders to how long it took to get our order;;;;
5486;i got the wings - terrible even though they are a signature dish;;;;
5487;bland small bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout;;;;
5488;now that i think about it i don't know why i didn't complain and send it back;;;;
5489;maybe i was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a bloody mary;;;;
5490;i'd go back just for that;;;;
5491;i'd stay away for everything else (well the jack daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point;;;;
5492;two stars or even one if not for the bloody mary meal or jack daniels chocolate cake;;;;
5493;we love kneader's! their french toast is literally the best french toast ever;;;;
5494;and their breakfast sandwich on a croissant is sooooo yummy;;;;
5495;we always have the best service there;;;;
5496;workers are nice and friendly and we get our food quickly;;;;
5497;highly recommend kneaders! a great place to go to brunch with friends;;;;
5498;brfc is a solid place to try some really good chicken;;;;
5499;i've been very happy on my recent visits to brfc;;;;
5500;our chicken combos were tender juicy crispy and flavorful;;;;
5501;we like to order their chicken tender combos and dip them in all their different sauces;;;;
5502;my husband and i really enjoy it and plan on returning;;;;
5503;pros;;;;
5504;* friendly & efficient service when you order at the counter;;;;
5505;* clean and modern decor with plenty of seating/table options and large windows;;;;
5506;* large tvs (we watched football during one of our visits);;;;
5507;* combos include their shoestring fries and small cup of coleslaw;;;;
5508;fries;;;;
5509;skinny crispy salty and plentiful;;;;
5510;coleslaw;;;;
5511;a bit bland for my taste;;;;
5512;* their juicy chicken has a nice crisp crunch with a tasty and flavorful seasoning;;;;
5513;their chicken is delicious with a slight spicy dry coating (a hint of cajun);;;;
5514;we do not find it to be greasy and the breading was light and not overwhelming;;;;
5515;* their boylan pop is served at a soda fountain and is sweetened with cane sugar and refillable;;;;
5516;* their iced tea is sweetened with honey or unsweetened and refillable;;;;
5517;* milkshakes are thick and creamy and my husband always orders one with his chicken;;;;
5518;* honey dipping sauce options;;;;
5519;wildflower chipotle and wasabi honey flavors;;;;
5520;i love all their honey options for my chicken tenders;;;;
5521;* other dipping sauce options;;;;
5522;habanero hot sauce and their own brbbq barbecue dip;;;;
5523;* lunch box special deal;;;;
5524;m-f;;;;
5525;11am - 4pm;;;;
5526;3 whole wings fries and a drink = 8 bucks;;;;
5527;cons;;;;
5528;* it seems a bit pricey for what it is;;;;
5529;essentially it is priced a little higher than what you would expect for a chicken joint;;;;
5530;you're looking at $10 - $15 a person for combos;;;;
5531;however i do find it to be a higher quality than most chicken joints;;;;
5532;it's an upscale atmosphere for a 'fast casual' restaurant;;;;
5533;review 1 for 2017;;;;
5534;pretty good for a first time;;;;
5535;my ubereats delivery experience was mediocre but the pizza was one of the best i've tried so far;;;;
5536;i ordered the mediterranean and it had a lot of flavor from all the different veggies and spices;;;;
5537;my only complaint is;;;;
5538;the crust was a bit dry a little more olive oil wouldn't have hurt;;;;
5539;i'm very captious about my pizza but i honestly state i would order another one again in the future;;;;
5540;this place no longer exists;;;;
5541;the site is empty and available for rent;;;;
5542;too bad not sure if another quilt shop close by!;;;;
5543;i both attended and hosted multiple events at sigmas - training executive offsite meeting and a retirement party;;;;
5544;the staff are professional and very organized;;;;
5545;every detail  has been considered - from extra insulated windows to keep out street noise to decaffeinated ice tea;;;;
5546;all the touches a trainer or meeting facilitator could wish for in the technology and variety of spaces (whether board room lunch cafe formal reception area or training room);;;;
5547;i wouldn't consider this aunthentic mexican food like my hubby does but it sure was tasty;;;;
5548;portions are nice and price is right;;;;
5549;i thoroughly enjoyed my chimichanga;;;;
5550;the enchiladas especially the seafood enchilada was flavourful;;;;
5551;i think i was a little suprised to find myself really liking the food;;;;
5552;its more american mexican food but it was good!;;;;
5553;the service i recieved was 5 stars;;;;
5554;everyone was nice i noticed there was mostly teenagers working there and they were very friendly and helpful;;;;
5555;they checked up on us to make sure everything was alright but they weren't overly obtrusive to where you feel bothered;;;;
5556;they put some restaurants to shame and this isn't even that type of restaurant;;;;
5557;definitely will be making this a regular place to go to;;;;
5558;we have been wanting to try this place since it opened and finally went saturday evening;;;;
5559;we sat on the patio and had some delicious cocktails;;;;
5560;we eventually went in and sat at a table for dinner;;;;
5561;the chicken and waffle appetizer was delicious;;;;
5562;for entrees we ordered the shrimp and grits and the steak;;;;
5563;everything was delicious except for that the cook could not get my steak right;;;;
5564;they tried three times to achieve medium rare but just couldn't get it right;;;;
5565;fortunately for me our waitress who was fabulous was more upset about it than i was;;;;
5566;she would take it back to the kitchen even before i had the opportunity to complain;;;;
5567;the manager stopped by and was so apologetic and gave us a gift card to come back;;;;
5568;even though i would probably never order the steak again we will definitely be back for the ambience the drinks the other yummy food but most of all for the excellent customer service that is so rare to find these days;;;;
5569;well done trey!  thank you!;;;;
5570;had brunch here sunday with a friend;;;;
5571;the meal was very good;;;;
5572;i mean the options were limited but over all a solid brunch! i've only come to brewsters on one other occasion so i can't speak to the service before as it was at another location in calgary;;;;
5573;the place wasn't busy;;;;
5574;the staff was rather slow but the food was good so no complaints on that;;;;
5575;i had the southwestern omelette and i loved the salsa inside it was so yummy and really added a nice touch to the meal;;;;
5576;prices were also fair;;;;
5577;i decided to branch out from my usual egg benny;;;;
5578;it was a nice change;;;;
5579;loved the new york decor;;;;
5580;pretty sure the owner was working the cash register(you could tell he's from ny) there was around 100 things on the menu;;;;
5581;for a sandwich joint i think that's a little much so it took me a few minutes to decide;;;;
5582;"food was so-so it would of been a lot better if the ""grade"" of meat was better";;;;
5583;the owner also didn't seam to happy i mean c'mon man! if your gonna have your own business love it! don't look like your gonna kill the next person who orders a sandwich;;;;
5584;the amazing food and friendly atmosphere keeps us coming back!! my hubby is vegetarian and we love how we can choose anything off the menu for the both of us and it tastes delicious!;;;;
5585;i honestly love this location! blanca is always so welcoming and friendly;;;;
5586;her personality definitely makes it a fun experience! every time i come in my food is fresh or if i ask for it to be made fresh they will make it;;;;
5587;we ordered the orange chicken and kung pow chicken tonight and it was soooo yummy;;;;
5588;i love coming back here because the staff makes me feel like i live in a small town where people know each other and say hi with a smile;;;;
5589;i'm not sure how i rate this restaurant because i walked in to get some soup;;;;
5590;it was around 4pm and i was in destroyed need of something that would clear my sinuses;;;;
5591;hot and sour soap always does the trick;;;;
5592;i was told that i couldn't order a cup because it was supper time;;;;
5593;that's okay so i ordered a bowl of soup to take home;;;;
5594;it was 11;;;;
5595;00 and that okay too;;;;
5596;my only thing is that it looked like a cup and the soup was not too fresh;;;;
5597;it was good though;;;;
5598;i'm not too sure if i would go back because the prices seemed too high and for a bowl of soup being 11;;;;
5599;00 it wasn't great and there was much but broth;;;;
5600;my neighbourhood bar;;;;
5601;i love the staff and often drink with them;;;;
5602;til the wee hours;;;;
5603;great daily food and drink specials;;;;
5604;cheap pool and darts;;;;
5605;good atmosphere for sports games on one of them many televisions;;;;
5606;there just isn't any better way to watch a movie;;;;
5607;sound is incredible;;;;
5608;picture is awesome;;;;
5609;i actually travel 1hr to see movies at this theater;;;;
5610;we had breakfast there today for about $25 each with tax and fees included but 2 of our party of 4 were covered by the bed and breakfast deal from jw marriott and they didn't charge for the kid;;;;
5611;food was ok but plentiful and what makes it a 5-star for me is the ambience and the patio with the beautiful koi pond and cascades refreshing in a summer morning;;;;
5612;staff was attentive amd we were there at 10 and breakfast ends at 11 but didn't fell pressured at all and nobody gave us looks for taking some fruit with us on our way out;;;;
5613;"got another cut and had my first ever straight razor face shave from thom ""slick boy""";;;;
5614;book an appointment with this master barber who has mad skills and takes his time making it right;;;;
5615;he makes you feel comfortable with his laid back vibe and easy conversation;;;;
5616;he doesn't disappoint;;;;
5617;you walk out looking and feeling awesome;;;;
5618;really confused about the high star rating here;;;;
5619;i was actually excited for airport food due to the high yelp reviews;;;;
5620;should have dialed down my expectations?  i got the teriyaki chicken with brown rice;;;;
5621;the rice and chicken were both really dry;;;;
5622;the veggies were soggy;;;;
5623;service was great unlike some other posters but that did not make up for the food;;;;
5624;maybe i ordered the wrong thing?;;;;
5625;price was right - under $10 for food with tax;;;;
5626;very helpful staff;;;;
5627;location was a little farther than the home depot;;;;
5628;after the yelp coupon the prices for the items that i purchased was on par with lowest and home depot;;;;
5629;those big box stores are ok;;;;
5630;however i am trying to support the local economy;;;;
5631;with an adequate selection friendly staff and close location i will continue to spend my money there;;;;
5632;so fresh and delicious! my go to poke spot in the city! generous portions clean and great selection of accouterments!;;;;
5633;had a fantastic experience at this barber shop;;;;
5634;claude was fantastic and is such a great person to talk to while in the chair;;;;
5635;this is an art to him not just a haircut;;;;
5636;he takes his time and has great conversation with his patrons;;;;
5637;such a wealth of knowledge on the area and such a fantastic person to talk to;;;;
5638;greatly appreciated his service and his skill;;;;
5639;kudos to claude!!!;;;;
5640;the venetian is an elegant and distinguished resort and casino;;;;
5641;gorgeous and romantic decor and interior;;;;
5642;on the way to your room you are greeted by candlelit hallways and ceilings to light your way;;;;
5643;even though i didn't try the restaurant bouchon the smells emanating from the kitchen made my mouth water;;;;
5644;the casino was expansive and had signs everywhere for easy navigation;;;;
5645;rooms are huge clean and well-maintained;;;;
5646;the convenience store and bakery/coffeeshop is located at the entrance to the casino and near the elevators to the rooms which is a plus if you need to get a quick pick-me-up or forgot to pack something;;;;
5647;the venetian is a must-stay if you are ever in las vegas and will give you a dining gambling and staying experience that you will never forget;;;;
5648;my experience with dr;;;;
5649;malek has been nothing short of fantastic;;;;
5650;his staff is professional and kind and they're great at answering questions without being pushy or sales-like;;;;
5651;malek was kind while retaining a very professional demeanor;;;;
5652;"(honestly the first time i met with him i had almost wished that he had been a bit more ""friendly"" vs";;;;
5653;doctor-patient but he was obviously experienced and competent;;;;
5654;on the day of the surgery i appreciated that bit of professional distance that he kept and felt comfortable in his hands and under his care;;;;
5655;)  he and his staff were great about working with my crazy schedule and finding times that would work for me;;;;
5656;everything was very upfront;;;;
5657;there were zero hidden charges or unexpected costs;;;;
5658;malek customized the procedure to obtain the best results for my particular situation and explained to me in detail what he suggested and why he felt it was the best approach;;;;
5659;the results are incrdible;;;;
5660;(i've used the word magician quite a few times when speaking about dr;;;;
5661;malek's skill;;;;
5662;) pain or discomfort was exremely minimal and i can't begin to describe how thrilled i am that i chose to have the procedure done and to have dr;;;;
5663;malek do it;;;;
5664;i visited beltway for the first time during the hunt for my first handgun at the beginning of the year;;;;
5665;from my very first interaction with branden i gathered that they are more honest and forthright than several that i had visited;;;;
5666;they are well informed but might not have answers to all your questions;;;;
5667;however they would help search for the proper answer rather than mislead you;;;;
5668;i have bought a few guns several accessories and a scope from here after (offcourse) doing my due diligence;;;;
5669;i have been extremely satisfied with all my purchases;;;;
5670;you can expect friendly personnel reasonable prices and great communication at beltway;;;;
5671;very disappointing;;;;
5672;overpriced mediocre food;;;;
5673;refried beans served with fajitas were so hot that they not only burned my tongue but throat as well;;;;
5674;just got one of the worst haircuts of my life from a girl named alex;;;;
5675;had to go home and use my own clippers to cut away her terrible job! terrible! beware;;;;
5676;this place was worth the taxi ride! the food was great and affordable! the atmosphere was fun and it is nice that it is a little bit off the strip and away from the chaos;;;;
5677;the portions were huge and my friend and i ordered several items to split between us;;;;
5678;there are great breakfast options and there is a very casual vibe;;;;
5679;my wife ate here and i had pizza from another place she had the vinnys sandwich and it was huge and it was so huge and so much she ate half and couldn't eat no more gave the other half to a older lady later that day we saw her walking down the strip and she said the sandwich was excellent to my wife really liked it it was just too much for one person to eat;;;;
5680;yeah service continues to go downhill;;;;
5681;take your money elsewhere;;;;
5682;paid for the works;;;;
5683;they didn't even wipe the dash or any of the interior;;;;
5684;outside still has crap all over it;;;;
5685;should have gone back inside and asked for a refund;;;;
5686;this place sucks;;;;
5687;these people are amazingly friendly helpful and have high integrity;;;;
5688;i feel very happy to have found them when i moved back to phoenix and need someone to care for my car;;;;
5689;wow so delicious;;;;
5690;i don't have any pictures to post because we ate everything too fast!;;;;
5691;we used the check-for free coffee and tea to start while we munched on the complementary granola which was a nice roasted salty and sweet flavor;;;;
5692;then our savory crepes came out quickly the breakfast burrito for him and a custom buckwheat for me (white cheddar since they were out of gouda with local ham);;;;
5693;mine came with a side of dressed greens that complemented the crepe well;;;;
5694;i was disappointed i could only order scrambled eggs on the side when i wanted a gooey poached egg because they had already cracked all the eggs so i skipped the eggs;;;;
5695;as we finished up our main course our sweet crepe came out;;;;
5696;i was surprised how full i was from the one savory crepe but i made room for my half of a simple bruleed crepe with nuts;;;;
5697;you can really taste the quality of the crepe itself when it's minimally dressed;;;;
5698;we finished with the complementary dessert of chocolate triangles and a rose infused marshmallow roasted right at the table;;;;
5699;overall i'm very happy with our experience and the friendly service;;;;
5700;we struck up some good conversation with the server and found everyone but the cashier to be friendly;;;;
5701;i will definitely be back soon!;;;;
5702;keep in mind i only eat here once in awhile cuz the food is very cheap and taste ok;;;;
5703;the wait staff from about 11am on are pretty nice;;;;
5704;before that time get ready to deal with dawn of the living dead;;;;
5705;they're like pissed off zombies;;;;
5706;"which sucks cuz this place's best deal is their ""before 11am $2";;;;
5707;49 breakfast;;;;
5708;i've had everything from their eggs benedict to their salad bar;;;;
5709;their salad bar is very basic;;;;
5710;cheap square croutons fake baco bits half-wilted(so take your time picking out the good lettuce and leave the crap to another patron haha) lettuce and ok dressings;;;;
5711;i get it;;;;
5712;they can't have fresh stuff at this price;;;;
5713;back to the eggs benedict;;;;
5714;everything on the benny was cheap;;;;
5715;the english muffin wasn't toasted! never seen that before;;;;
5716;the hash browns were way too crispy;;;;
5717;like eating unflavored pop rocks;;;;
5718;the hollandaise sauce was just ok;;;;
5719;all in all if you're very hungry and either cheap or on a budget stop on in;;;;
5720;then again sunset station is close by and their $7-8 buffet is way better!;;;;
5721;i came here on a saturday night for dinner to celebrate my 25th birthday with the best of company fun entertainment and delicious food!!! i'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant;;;;
5722;had no clue how huge this place was!!! we sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) the ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o;;;;
5723;o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! there were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment;;;;
5724;but enough of that on to the main event;;;;
5725;we had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested omakase style;;;;
5726;- cucumber cocktail on the house!!! they brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going;;;;
5727;- a trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame roasted shito peppers and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but i think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a;;;;
5728;- yellowtail sashimi mini tacos!!! these were sooo fun and delicious! great fushion idea! the restaurant is very accommodating we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! the fla;;;;
5729;but i think i still enjoy dos camino's mini tacos better;;;;
5730;those are to;;;;
5731;die;;;;
5732;for;;;;
5733;#NAME?;;;;
5734;this was an interesting combination;;;;
5735;probably my least favorite dish of the night;;;;
5736;the basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much;;;;
5737;#NAME?;;;;
5738;the meat was tender and very well cooked very pink in the middle;;;;
5739;i'm not a big beef eater so i only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it;;;;
5740;definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy;;;;
5741;the asparagus however was quite delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter;;;;
5742;hahaha i'll take it;;;;
5743;) a good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside!;;;;
5744;- sea bass with oversized peruvian corn!!! yummmy!!!! the sea bass was nice and flaky;;;;
5745;flavoring was a bit salty but i feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit;;;;
5746;i mean everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want lol the peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! my friends really enjoyed it but i definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better;;;;
5747;#NAME?;;;;
5748;this was definitely the show stopper of the night!!! the flavoring of the sauce the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms;;;;
5749;happiness;;;;
5750;the sauce was like a cream of mushroom milky full flavored salty a hint of sweetness;;;;
5751;too good;;;;
5752;needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction;;;;
5753;we all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!!;;;;
5754;- 4 different sushi rolls were brought out last (3;;;;
5755;5 stars);;;;
5756;all 4 were decent nothing really to rave much about unfortunately;;;;
5757;(  i'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so i can't pretend these were anything to die for;;;;
5758;***the first time i came my friend ordered for the table and i definitely think that made a difference;;;;
5759;they have some really scrumptious dishes that i wish i could've ordered for my friends to try!! perhaps next time!! i'll be more prepared lol;;;;
5760;overall ratings;;;;
5761;food - 3;;;;
5762;75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack;;;;
5763;5 stars for that);;;;
5764;food (for the first time i came) - 4;;;;
5765;25 stars!;;;;
5766;drink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of santa margaritta pino grigio;;;;
5767;presentation - 4 stars;;;;
5768;service & ambiance - 4 stars;;;;
5769;i gave this place 4 stars mainly because i had a great time that night and the company i kept definitely played a big part in that;;;;
5770;the food is goood just a bit $$$$;;;;
5771;its definitely a great place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats good drinks and a great time;;;;
5772;o) bottom line;;;;
5773;i'd definitely go back again!!;;;;
5774;always taken care of at this company;;;;
5775;this was my first visit to this location since moving from the east side and tony really took care of me with a price match;;;;
5776;these guys here are great at customer service and once again left extremely happy;;;;
5777;if you need tires this is a must visit;;;;
5778;4 stars means i'm a fan and yes id agree with that;;;;
5779;however what is putting them from a solid 3 to a 4 is the value and service;;;;
5780;seriously a chopped or caesar salad for 3;;;;
5781;95? 5-7pm happy hour that includes half off starters pizzas and glasses of wine wow for real!;;;;
5782;so with that being said we had a great time at marcella's yes folks a chain but a decent chain with only a few locations in ohio;;;;
5783;the straight forward menu makes for easy navigation and the helpful suggestive service was more than enough to make decisions easy;;;;
5784;okay we kinda freaked out when  we heard the half off starts and pizzas;;;;
5785;we ordered way to much but was so worth it;;;;
5786;started with the meaty sicilian pizza topped with capacola salami meatballs asiago cheese red onion which was probably my favorite;;;;
5787;the crust was thin and crunchy and all of the flavors of the meats and cheese really were balanced so i could taste each with one bite after the next;;;;
5788;beef carpaccio was a close runner up with its thinly shaved rare beef toasted capers and wild arugula;;;;
5789;the flavors were bright thanks in part to the lemon aioli;;;;
5790;the braised veal meatball was so light and tender i wanted to order another as my entree rather than the gnocchi con bolognese;;;;
5791;the problem with the gnocchi was the gnocchi themselves;;;;
5792;kind of like eating raw biscuit dough but the lamb bolognese was simple and delicious;;;;
5793;the chicken parmesan was served how i like to eat with both alfredo & tomato sauce;;;;
5794;my only wish is that it had just a bit more sauce so i could use the house ciabatta to sop up the extra;;;;
5795;desserts are kept simple like the rest of the menu so we shared with cherry crustada;;;;
5796;the crust was light and flaky the cherries filling slightly tart and the ice cream rich and creamy *pant pant* yum!;;;;
5797;this was certainly a pleasant experience with a welcoming laid back feel generous portions and affordable pricing;;;;
5798;oh yes they also use opentable;;;;
5799;com for free online reservations so yes i'm definitely a fan!!!;;;;
5800;i have purchased two carpets here and went for my third today;;;;
5801;the first two worked out just fine;;;;
5802;you save a little money by having very limited customer service but it has good variety as long as you are good with looking on your own;;;;
5803;today we found a carpet we wanted and asked the sales guy to come over to price it out;;;;
5804;it is an 8x10 and he gave the price we agreed and then he went to write us up;;;;
5805;when we went to pay i noticed the price was different that the quote from 10 minutes ago by about $40;;;;
5806;"he said i needed to buy 8x12 instead because they don't have a use for the other 2""";;;;
5807;well neither do i this was not in the agreed upon price and it is a remnant so they can cut however they want;;;;
5808;the bottom line here is that they were not honest and did not honor the direct quote given;;;;
5809;most of all it feels like they are taking advantage of people by giving a price and then changing it without telling you;;;;
5810;good carpet variety but a lack of integrity and honesty;;;;
5811;maybe it is a new guy but the owner didn't help;;;;
5812;be careful that the price they give is the same when you pay the bill;;;;
5813;my daughter and her boyfriend were very excited to go here;;;;
5814;they paid almost $200 for 2 buffet of buffet 24 hour passes;;;;
5815;they had crab sushi shrimp and oysters;;;;
5816;then about 2 hours later she started feeling very sick;;;;
5817;for the next 2 days she could barely move  vomiting  diarrhea cold sweats;;;;
5818;her whole vacation was ruined;;;;
5819;we returned to the rio seafood buffet talked to manager mike;;;;
5820;filled out the security forms  with the emt;;;;
5821;mike tells us that even though she got food poisoning from there seafood;;;;
5822;and could not use the 24 hour pass;;;;
5823;he could not give a refund;;;;
5824;but he offered a free buffet if she wanted to eat there again;;;;
5825;really ???;;;;
5826;good luck eating here!!!!;;;;
5827;you go to a casino to gamble money ,not your health!;;;;
5828;one of my coworkers mentioned this little spot he heard about not too far from work;;;;
5829;so today for lunch a few of us decided to check it out;;;;
5830;my personal favorite places are hole in the wall joints so walking into this restaurant definitely provided that vibe;;;;
5831;miss dee the owner i believe was one of the nicest owners i have met at a restaurant;;;;
5832;she immediately came out of the kitchen and personally greeted us with amazing hospitality;;;;
5833;she gave us the low down of her spot answering any questions about the food we had;;;;
5834;now onto the meat and potatoes literally! three of us got a large loaded potato each topped with different meats;;;;
5835;one had the beef brisket the other had pulled pork and i got the buffalo chicken;;;;
5836;don't expect your food to come out in a minute like it was just microwaved;;;;
5837;everything was freshly put together and it was beyond worth it! each meat was cooked to perfection with amazing flavors throughout the potato;;;;
5838;combine that with melted cheese sour cream and other delicious toppings this potato can't be beat!  will definitely be a return customer to try out other various customizations on my loaded potato!;;;;
5839;we enjoyed excellent service and very good food;;;;
5840;salads were perfect as was soft shell crab and chicken livers;;;;
5841;broad pasta was excellent as was scottish beef;;;;
5842;very good and extensive wine list;;;;
5843;wonderful experience and good value for the price;;;;
5844;i miss tram so much i wish i could've taken her with me to az she's knows what i want and exactly how i want my hands to look;;;;
5845;whenever i needed her to fix a nail she did it without complaints she was always happy to perfect my hands;;;;
5846;i honestly didn't find this place to be all that;;;;
5847;don't get me wrong its a nice modern place but i can find better made items that honey salt offers for way cheaper price;;;;
5848;the only good thing that i was blown away by is their fried calamari;;;;
5849;that was a pretty legit dish;;;;
5850;their biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich i believe i can get somewhere else for cheaper and made better;;;;
5851;"we also got their caesars salad and that was literally 14 dollars for some salad with a touch of caesars dressing and some cheap ""free range"" chicken breast that was grilled";;;;
5852;overall not too impressed with what they served;;;;
5853;and this is on a hunch but if bread was given to everyone as an opener then they most def didn't care for us;;;;
5854;everyone else had bread on their tables but us don't know if you had to order it or not;;;;
5855;again overall the place is well lit and looks great;;;;
5856;foodwise;;;;
5857;id go somewhere else;;;;
5858;as a local i should've known better but wanted to try something new;;;;
5859;now i know i won't go back;;;;
5860;there are other places around town to get same food for cheaper price and same quality;;;;
5861;good luck;;;;
5862;today my friend and i came in for a body massage;;;;
5863;let me tell you! the staff was very consistent they ask you if you're okay while giving you massage in troubled areas;;;;
5864;very relaxing and clean;;;;
5865;i didn't get my misuses name but she did a fantastic job;;;;
5866;and i came home feeling so relaxed with no more tight pressure in my back;;;;
5867;i am so happy my friend and i chose this place;;;;
5868;when i was looking for a new groomer as my old one was moving out of town i was asking my groomer at the time who she would recommend and she mentioned diane at razzle dazzle;;;;
5869;"i can start with saying i was a little hesitant about taking my ""kids"" to just anyone 1) razzle dazzle is out of my way about 10 miles and 2) she was new";;;;
5870;i'm so glad i called diane and after talking to her on the phone i felt confident that she was the one who would take over caring for my little ones;;;;
5871;"i have been taking my ""kids"" to razzle dazzle now for a couple years";;;;
5872;"all i can is diane is simply amazing!!!! let's just say i would travel an additional 30 miles if it meant that diane would still be caring for my ""kids""";;;;
5873;i called them at 10;;;;
5874;30 saying ill be there in 15 minutes given they close at 11;;;;
5875;when i arrived with a party of 15 ( which i mentioned on the phone) they denied me and were extremely rude;;;;
5876;lack of professionalism and courtesy;;;;
5877;five stars for the iced espresso bianco!!!  i am not an iced coffee fan whatsoever but this was amazing;;;;
5878;we were at the venetian for date night - dinner and a show so got here early to walk around;;;;
5879;we stopped in here to get a drink and i took a chance on this drink;;;;
5880;i did get the caramel flavor but it was not to flavored which i was happy about;;;;
5881;not sure how they layered it but the frothed milk was on top and it mixed it on its own and/or with stirring - so flavorful;;;;
5882;this drink really kept the coffee flavor without getting diluted by the ice or caramel;;;;
5883;i wish i had one later today!;;;;
5884;bought a bow here;;;;
5885;they have nice equipment;;;;
5886;but the staff member i worked with seemed like he didnt have time for me and any questions i had;;;;
5887;i got a too cool for school kind of vibe here;;;;
5888;should have purchased elsewhere and i wont be going back;;;;
5889;told my close friend to take his $1200 bow purchase elsewhere;;;;
5890;sportsmans warehouse has much friendlier customer service;;;;
5891;i loved this buffet;;;;
5892;to me it was comparable to the buffet at the wynn;;;;
5893;they had prime rib warm snow crab legs ceviche sushi an omelet bar and a little of everything;;;;
5894;tons of desserts as well!! define lay coming back next trip to vegas;;;;
5895;oh my goodness;;;;
5896;where to start?!! i had the pleasure of enjoying some bbq chicken beans and potato salad about a week ago;;;;
5897;not only was the meat perfectly tender and juicy but the beans oh my god the beans;;;;
5898;talk about perfection;;;;
5899;on top of the delicious food the service i received was beyond 5 stars;;;;
5900;i was offered a sample while working and was told he could bring the food into me at my convenience but i didn't take advantage assuming that i would be able to catch him outside and take a look at my options;;;;
5901;unfortunately for me as i was walking out of the building steven was pulling away;;;;
5902;he saw me though and as i expressed my sadness in missing my opportunity;;;;
5903;he so kindly and without hesitation pulled over and prepared me the dish of my choosing;;;;
5904;he was so gracious and even gave me a small story of how he got started;;;;
5905;i would recommend holy smoke bbq to anyone and everyone! my heart and my belly were so full! thank you again for your extremely generous service!;;;;
5906;good food but service sucks;;;;
5907;waitress apparently was in a rush serving appetizers and burger plates at the same time;;;;
5908;didn't ask for desert and brought the bill and the credit card machine all together;;;;
5909;almost cleaning the table as we were sitting at the table;;;;
5910;no smile no care;;;;
5911;almost rude;;;;
5912;the store has a nice men's department downstairs;;;;
5913;the sale items are all the way in the back near the dressing rooms check it out for great deals;;;;
5914;the salespeople are friendly and helpful;;;;
5915;this store has a great coffee shop right by the men's department;;;;
5916;where you can get a drink and a pastry;;;;
5917;comfy seating makes it for a great little coffee spot;;;;
5918;club monaco is a bit on the pricey side but i usually find great sales that are a great value;;;;
5919;i love this nail salon;;;;
5920;they are very friendly and attentive;;;;
5921;they make the experience fun;;;;
5922;my nails turned out greeeeeeat;;;;
5923;i'm moving across town but this will still be my nail salon;;;;
5924;you travel for good service;;;;
5925;pros;;;;
5926;i love this lee's location! it's my favorite to go to since it's near my home;;;;
5927;it has everything you would want they even have a growing sake collection!! they restock a lot;;;;
5928;the staff is really helpful i'm always asking them questions and they are nice and pretty knowledgable;;;;
5929;there are always good prices;;;;
5930;cons;;;;
5931;sort of back alley private area;;;;
5932;it's a little cluttered and heavily stacked inside!;;;;
5933;overall;;;;
5934;by going here you have the ability to make any outing into a good time;;;;
5935;so the food is pretty good but overpriced;;;;
5936;the thing that irks me is there was basically no alcohol in the caesars i ordered;;;;
5937;i am small i had two and i wasn't even tipsy;;;;
5938;no taste of alcohol no feel of it;;;;
5939;super lame;;;;
5940;also no happy hour;;;;
5941;what can you say about this place that hasn't already been said;;;;
5942;the hype is true and we're lucky to have nationally renown chef chris bianco stay here in phoenix all these years;;;;
5943;pizzas are perfect and pastas are surprisingly great & fresh (if you can resist ordering a pizza);;;;
5944;menu is often changing and new additions and recommendations are usually worth taking;;;;
5945;have not yet been to the original downtown location am intimidated by no reservations and what i expect to be long lines for a reputable place;;;;
5946;"the ""town & country"" location is fashionable shabby chic not intimidating";;;;
5947;parking is kind of a cluster;;;;
5948;look forward to coming here again on the next possible date night;;;;
5949;yet another example of a business cashing in on location at the expense of quality;;;;
5950;cocktails are chain-restaurant worthy wine list is weak and seafood is only barely competently prepared;;;;
5951;calamari was good;;;;
5952;worth it served with a large pool (at least 2 cups) of seasoned mayo;;;;
5953;lobster roll was rubbery and tasteless;;;;
5954;the bun was exceptional however;;;;
5955;"the salmon was kirkland's best and ""crusted with pecans""=sprinkled";;;;
5956;hmm;;;;
5957;the grouper sandwiches were passable;;;;
5958;mccain fries;;;;
5959;yum;;;;
5960;the day was sunny;;;;
5961;the company was excellent;;;;
5962;i noted the the pump ouse grill on lakeshore;;;;
5963;i'll park there next time and enjoy the wings;;;;
5964;my sister-in-law and i saw jeff at the start of the year;;;;
5965;we saw his ad and we decided it was something we would want to check out;;;;
5966;and we are so glad we did!;;;;
5967;jeff is hilarious and has great stage presence and really connects with his audience;;;;
5968;i even got pulled up on stage and got a crotch full of jeff!  hahaha;;;;
5969;it's a very high energy show that he never lets up;;;;
5970;he just goes and performs his little heart out much to the enjoyment of the audience;;;;
5971;if you're looking for a family friendly show that is different from the usual entertainment on the strip then you cannot go wrong with jeff civillico!;;;;
5972;remember 98 south wine bar?;;;;
5973;or the 2nd 98 south wine bar?;;;;
5974;or fat cat?  that space in downtown chandler has a new tenant and they seem like a keeper;;;;
5975;dc steak house is a rarity in phoenix;;;;
5976;a mid-priced independent steak houses in a sea of chain restaurants and a la carte wallet busters;;;;
5977;looks;;;;
5978;well it does look fairly similar to the previous restaurants except they changed the bar area and the art;;;;
5979;i like it;;;;
5980;it's elegant and not too dark or too partitioned;;;;
5981;there's a mural on one wall that i think the owner painted;;;;
5982;the place is a nice addition to downtown which is still fighting off the urban sprawl of mega-chains;;;;
5983;crowd;;;;
5984;seemed happening although it was opening night;;;;
5985;a wide mix of young and old;;;;
5986;food;;;;
5987;my eye was drawn to the large selection of fish but i decided to go with steak at a steak house;;;;
5988;the salad was solid;;;;
5989;i especially liked the italian dressing with a little feta cheese in it;;;;
5990;bread was ok;;;;
5991;my steak was great tender flavorful and perfectly cooked;;;;
5992;served with a (undercooked) baked potato and sauteed mushrooms;;;;
5993;my friend ordered the walleye;;;;
5994;i was a big fan but he said it was a little bland compared to what he catches in minnesota;;;;
5995;maybe that was a fish story;;;;
5996;value;;;;
5997;here's where i thought this place shined;;;;
5998;meals were in the $18-30 range including salad and potato;;;;
5999;they have $10 sandwiches too but they're not served on fri/sat until after 9pm;;;;
6000;seems fair;;;;
6001;service;;;;
6002;service was slow although it was opening night;;;;
6003;they also screwed up my friend's appetizer serving him the wrong kind of wing sauce;;;;
6004;however the people could not have been nicer;;;;
6005;the owner apologized and bought us desserts;;;;
6006;(chocolate decadence cake was delicious although a little rich for my taste;;;;
6007;)  then the chef came out  shook our hands and bought us drinks;;;;
6008;i felt like i was in a place where people would remember my name even though they surely won't;;;;
6009;miscellaneous;;;;
6010;a lot of decisions haven't been made yet;;;;
6011;will they serve lunch?  what will they do for happy hour? (a crucial decision in my mind;;;;
6012;)  even the menu will likely vary in the coming months;;;;
6013;verdict;;;;
6014;"i don't go out for steaks often even reasonably priced ones but i'll definitely be back to dc steakhouse to see my new ""friends";;;;
6015;"""  i've got my eye on the steak sandwich for next time";;;;
6016;previously my review was removed;;;;
6017;so let's try again;;;;
6018;i started to come here in 2011 and i loved neos;;;;
6019;but now if i could i would give this place a zero;;;;
6020;sherrie was the girl that always did my laser and it was comfortable to be around;;;;
6021;as my six treatments went up i signed up and made a new package and then soon again those six were up and i signed up again;;;;
6022;this time though i spoke to monica before i signed anything;;;;
6023;i wanted to make sure i would get a refund for any treatments if sherrie was to leave or if they were to move locations because i was well aware that their policies are not very consumer-friendly;;;;
6024;well guess what? they moved locations and nobody told me and my appt;;;;
6025;had been cancelled;;;;
6026;i called neos to see what the deal was and brian was super rude and said he would never agree to a refund even though it is written in my chart;;;;
6027;"he said he can ""make it worth my while"" to drive all the way to another office which is 45 minutes from my house when i was only driving 20 to peoria";;;;
6028;he offered me a free microderm;;;;
6029;"i'm 20 and i told him i don't want one and he said that he would suggest it since my face needs a ""detailing""";;;;
6030;if that isn't rude i don't know what is;;;;
6031;it gets better because he told me his tech charlene is great and that she is better then sherrie and has a lot more experience;;;;
6032;i did not think that it was professional to talk trash about former employees;;;;
6033;especially when i have done so many  treatments with them;;;;
6034;i have requested my chart to be faxed to me and nobody has gotten back to me;;;;
6035;i had two treatments left and he wouldn't refund those treatments even though i have been a loyal customer for so long;;;;
6036;instead of microderms how about paying for gas and miles? super rude service do not go here;;;;
6037;i love mexican food;;;;
6038;i live across from the fajita grill;;;;
6039;i have only been there twice (in 4 years);;;;
6040;as many of the other reviewers have said the food is sub-par mexican food;;;;
6041;i appreciated the complementary chips and salsa and the incredibly unhealthy boat dip was pretty decent;;;;
6042;i had the tofu mexicana which was mushy tofu and overcooked vegetables;;;;
6043;as hit or miss as mad mex can be since it opened i have been there more times than fajita grill;;;;
6044;it is byob but when i eat mexican i want an ice cold margarita;;;;
6045;they also charge for sharing plates ($2;;;;
6046;50) and ask that you split your check prior to ordering;;;;
6047;after an afternoon hike along the don river we were in dire need of some sweet sweet therapy;;;;
6048;close proximity to downtown we decided to venture towards lickadee split on coxwell;;;;
6049;i have a soft-spot for soft-serve and confectioneries! with a ton of selections to choose from lickadee split is a classic popular and awesome joint for some cool treats if you're ever in the east-end of the city;;;;
6050;beware their one scoop is a massive one thankfully the person helping me recommended i first see their quantity before being so keen on jumping on the two-scoop-wagon;;;;
6051;thankfully one was enough both jen and i each took something we liked;;;;
6052;chocolate fudge was for her;;;;
6053;over-decadent every chocolate-lovers love!;;;;
6054;gold ribbon- mix of caramel chocolate and vanilla i truly loved this trio of flavor each complemented one another;;;;
6055;truly delicious!;;;;
6056;i had the country fried steak and would recommend it;;;;
6057;it's pretty small in the dining area so i would not recommend a group larger than 4 even so 4 is pushing it;;;;
6058;knocked off 1 star for cash only;;;;
6059;certainly a fun place to shop;;;;
6060;the sales people are very nice they just really don't have a clue about anything and the parking is always a mess;;;;
6061;i bought a jacket today and it had an unusual rear pocket and i asked what was the purpose and they really didn't know so there best guess was that it could be for carrying your skies or poles lol;;;;
6062;i don't shop here often but it is the first place i will come when looking for sporting equipment/clothes;;;;
6063;i don't rely on the staff i do my research before i arrive;;;;
6064;i have bought many items here including skies inline skates ice skates and other odds and ends;;;;
6065;good selection and pleasant staff just not that bright;;;;
6066;bring your own light bulb! lol;;;;
6067;watch out for the parking on side streets;;;;
6068;i got towed once that is never fun;;;;
6069;this is just a great little find with great n'orleans-style food;;;;
6070;had the blackened trout;;;;
6071;bill had crayfish;;;;
6072;shared an appetizer of fried green tomatoes;;;;
6073;i normally don't care for collard greens but they were delicious;;;;
6074;you have to try the bread pudding if you have room;;;;
6075;pleasant staff;;;;
6076;good food;;;;
6077;what more can you ask for! oh yeah great variety of libations;;;;
6078;thank you for a new tega cay eatery that's good!!;;;;
6079;this was my first visit to top golf and i brought two family members visiting for the holidays;;;;
6080;the overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone we would rate this 5 stars - it is really fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event;;;;
6081;why two stars you ask?;;;;
6082;there are major issues with this place that test your patience;;;;
6083;first off when you walk in its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on friday);;;;
6084;there are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for or where to even stand in line;;;;
6085;"as it turns out the first line is the ""membership line"" - everyone needs a $5 membership";;;;
6086;"the second line is to ""check in"" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor";;;;
6087;both of those tasks sound so easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks;;;;
6088;the entire time we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once and rearrange things to make it easier;;;;
6089;after all we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in;;;;
6090;after all that we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited;;;;
6091;good selection of beer bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it;;;;
6092;then we get our text message - our bay is ready requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in) but thats the way they like it here i guess;;;;
6093;"we head to our bay with a ""bay concierge"" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play";;;;
6094;its not the most intuitive thing in the world but it works;;;;
6095;we start hitting balls and our waiter shows up;;;;
6096;"he literally walks us through the entire menu page by page explaining burgers and appetizers and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a ""slider"" was";;;;
6097;(mind you you pay by the hour at this place so someone taking your time is quite annoying);;;;
6098;we order a bucket of beer and chips and guac and shoo him off and get back to our golf;;;;
6099;beers arrive chips arrive - and our waiter arrives;;;;
6100;and stays;;;;
6101;and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from and his grandma in colorado and what it was like working after christmas and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about;;;;
6102;ugh leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer not a new pal;;;;
6103;"when the chips came out one in my party leaned over to the server and said ""do you know one thing thats missing in this place?""  the server leaned in all interested";;;;
6104;"""napkins - there are no napkins on the table""";;;;
6105;our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag and on and on and on;;;;
6106;and no napkins;;;;
6107;"he stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him ""could we have napkins?"" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times";;;;
6108;so we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips and he comes back with the beer and no chips (and again all chatty - does this guy have other tables?);;;;
6109;the refill of chips took about 20 minutes;;;;
6110;we came at an odd time and we were expected home for dinner but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good;;;;
6111;the kicker though was that near the end of our session our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after christmas there was a five hour wait and they ran out of food and booze and kegs etc;;;;
6112;he told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing;;;;
6113;he asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks and he would buy us desert if we said yes;;;;
6114;ok this is the business guy in me coming out now but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to improve and figure out where you are failing;;;;
6115;the fact that you have a 40 minute check in process or that you ran out of beer one night or that there are no napkins on the table or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are all issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated;;;;
6116;if i owned this place i would be pissed off;;;;
6117;again its a really fun concept but it will try on your nerves big time;;;;
6118;i tried nichiban for the first time and i definitely have to agree with the reviews from the other users for this restaurant;;;;
6119;it's a very small place tucked in a little corner of a small plaza right across pacific mall at steeles/kennedy but the food is delicious;;;;
6120;being a big fan of salmon sashimi i asked if the sashimi bento and other main courses containing sashimi can be replaced with all salmon sashimi and yes it can be done;;;;
6121;i had the salmon sashimi bento box accordingly and i have nothing but praise for the quality of the sashimi and the taste of the tempura spicy salmon sushi and even the salad that accompanied the bento;;;;
6122;they even gave us a huge plate of grilled salmon pieces all on the house - also quite yummy!  the only aspect that they can improve is to add a little dessert at the end such as green tea ice cream like many other little sushi restaurants tend to do however i am very content with this place just as it is;;;;
6123;i will definitely be returning to this place whenever i am in the area;;;;
6124;although the vibe and terrace are nice and trendy that's about all this place has to offer;;;;
6125;came here for drinks and dinner the cocktails were 10$ and were pretty small and not very strong but they have good variety;;;;
6126;the food was average at best and quite overpriced;;;;
6127;not authentic at all but i guess for a bar that is to be expected;;;;
6128;pad thai was flavourless and honestly thai express does it better;;;;
6129;/ the snacks to share are super pricy for what they are it was 10$ for 3 tiny satay skewers and another 10$ for 4 tiny pieces of popcorn chicken on a small bed of rice;;;;
6130;if youre coming here just for drinks i wouldnt say don't go but if youre looking for drinks and asian food i would 100% brasserie pamika it is much better in terms of flavour and authenticity and also has a cool trendy vibe;;;;
6131;best bean and cheese burrito in town!! our kids beg us to take them there weekly;;;;
6132;my sister used taco dilla's catering for a graduation/birthday party for her kids and they did a faboulos job;;;;
6133;the set up was top notch and the food was always well stocked;;;;
6134;their customer service was on point;;;;
6135;all of the food was amazing stand outs- steak and blue cheese quesadillas! yum yum;;;;
6136;been traveling to this restaurant for years;;;;
6137;can't believe they were out of gaucamole just lock the door!  abt 4pm only one other couple eating very slow svs;;;;
6138;think they do better evening svs when more servers;;;;
6139;than close during day!  at least 1 fam member needs to be around this is what happens when you trust fam bus to someone else!  food was ok but i have had better there;;;;
6140;disappointed but w return;;;;
6141;oh my gosh i fell in love with this place today! lots of vegan options delicious food - my fav was the falafel and baba ghanoush - and friendly service;;;;
6142;prices are reasonable too;;;;
6143;can't wait to go back for the open face eggplant soon!;;;;
6144;snobbish receptionist good waiters food is identical to any other cheese cake factory;;;;
6145;and finally they invented a slice of cake that's 1750 calories;;;;
6146;"that's art !!!  but their 500 calorie "" diet"" cheesecake is pretty good";;;;
6147;empty at lunchtime !;;;;
6148;fantastic time here!  i was so on the fence about my dress until i found one that i loved and happened to be one of rachel's favorites too;;;;
6149;she gave great service was incredibly helpful very clear on my options for altering the dress and was amazing with suggestions while taking my venue and overall style into consideration;;;;
6150;i love sonic;;;;
6151;i was raised in san diego and we didn't have any sonics so i was super excited to see them all over town here;;;;
6152;this is the location closest to my house so it's the one i visit most often;;;;
6153;i have never had bad service here;;;;
6154;all of the order takers and servers are friendly;;;;
6155;the burgers are nothing spectacular but are good;;;;
6156;i love that you have the option to have tater tots more fast food places should offer them as well!;;;;
6157;the drinks are the best part;;;;
6158;i love that you can customize your soda to add any flavor combination;;;;
6159;there is nothing like a raspberry limeade on a hot day!;;;;
6160;the desserts are also pretty delicious;;;;
6161;the best time of year is when they have the red velvet cake blast;;;;
6162;i wish they carried it year around;;;;
6163;(  the pumpkin pie blast is also a really good seasonal treat;;;;
6164;i do wish that they were open 24 hours but i believe they are open fairly late until 1am most nights;;;;
6165;"hands down best jerky!  i bought the sweet heat for myself which was the perfect amount of heat i ate the entire bag in one sitting!  my son loves the teriyaki beef and i couldn't forget my ""fur-kids"" i bought them a bag of the beef and a bag of the turkey top ten dog treats they went crazy for the stuff!  customer service was awesome too really cool guys working the shop";;;;
6166;love this place!;;;;
6167;i've stayed at all hotels on the strip;;;;
6168;even when stardust and frontier was around;;;;
6169;i've encountered the atmosphere the check-in lines the restaurants the pools and the nightclubs of these hotels;;;;
6170;hands down venetian & palazzo has the best to offer in luxury;;;;
6171;yes there are clubs better than tao and better restaurants than the grand lux but those hotels with don't have great service or great decor or rooms as the venetian;;;;
6172;it's like some hotels focus on one great trait (day club night club room accommodations) but the venetian has it all across the board;;;;
6173;tables are loose rooms are suite family side of pool and adult side;;;;
6174;cosmo is catching up though;;;;
6175;but yeah the venetian is definitely tight butthole;;;;
6176;first let me explain the 2 stars - we decided to try out the sushi after friends said it was good;;;;
6177;we got to smokin fins at 6;;;;
6178;30 pm thinking we had plenty of time before the happy hour menu was over at 7;;;;
6179;12:00 PM;;;;
6180;but the wait list was 40 minutes long and we did not get seated until 7;;;;
6181;10:00 PM;;;;
6182;since happy hour was over we did not get happy hour pricing even though we were waiting on the list for 40 minutes;;;;
6183;left a bad feeling about the service and management;;;;
6184;"i heard a few other couples expressing their opinions about the same thing but management just said ""sorry""  now for the good part";;;;
6185;the restaurant had a nice atmosphere and was relaxing inside and outside;;;;
6186;the food presentation was impressive;;;;
6187;service was just ok;;;;
6188;the sushi was cut very think and cooked just perfect;;;;
6189;if our dinners were not so good we would not return;;;;
6190;since the food was so good we will give smokin fins another chance on our next sushi craving;;;;
6191;egg-celent! was so delicious and would definitely recommend it;;;;
6192;i gave only 4 stars because i wish they had more options on their menu;;;;
6193;i didn't want bread and opted for the salad at no additional cost;;;;
6194;although the salad was good i'm not too sure about arugula with scrambled eggs and a slice of cheddar cheese;;;;
6195;is it good? couldn't really tell over the heat;;;;
6196;i knew this going in i like spicy and often think places under estimate how spicy they think their food is;;;;
6197;not here;;;;
6198;i had enchiladas they were spicy;;;;
6199;service was great atmosphere in the restaurant is colorful;;;;
6200;it is a great experience but probably won't make it onto the regular rotation;;;;
6201;looked this place up before making appointment april did a great job;;;;
6202;i had to wait a while even with an appointment but they apologized and serviced me and my daughter to our satisfaction;;;;
6203;their hot stone massage was great and you get a full foot and calf massage as part of the $20;;;;
6204;great price good service;;;;
6205;oan;;;;
6206;it was a little dusty in there;;;;
6207;they may want to look into remodeling but not if that is going to increase the prices;;;;
6208;good spot to satisfy a late night korean craving! hot bubbling gam ja tang hits the spot on a cold night;;;;
6209;seating was comfortable service was a little lacking but courteous;;;;
6210;could do with more sides! all in all a good place if you're looking for straightforward comfort food;;;;
6211;still the best dinner buffet on the strip;;;;
6212;start with the king crab and shrimp cocktails;;;;
6213;then move on the specialty meats;;;;
6214;everything sings quality;;;;
6215;especially the hand made desserts;;;;
6216;i went in with what felt like a laundry list of items to accomplish;;;;
6217;completely dreading and actually greatly postponing my visit i was incredibly surprised at how great and simple it was to accomplish what i needed;;;;
6218;ashley was lovely when she greeted me at the door to begin the process of helping me figure out what i needed and who to go to for help;;;;
6219;stephan has been incredible with assisting my every need answering all of my questions and making the process as simple as possible;;;;
6220;i am thrilled with the service i have received at this location and am glad i have made the move to boa;;;;
6221;their web site lured me in impressive as it is;;;;
6222;"""largest service fleet in the area";;;;
6223;etc;;;;
6224;etc;;;;
6225;they said they could fix our lg washer but then they didn't stock the parts had to special order them and when the new parts were installed the machine didn't work;;;;
6226;well they get zero stars for not fixing the washer;;;;
6227;they get zero stars for charging us for a service call when they had no real solution;;;;
6228;they were kind enough to remove the new (bad? wrong?) parts and to refund our money for them;;;;
6229;but then they gave up blaming lg for being a crappy company and suggesting we buy a whirlpool;;;;
6230;well maybe that's true and probably a good suggestion although this $900 washer was highly recommended by consumer reports about five years ago when we bought it;;;;
6231;you would think if they are authorized to repair lg washers that they would do a better job at customer service;;;;
6232;now i have to call lg file a complaint and find a *real* solution provider;;;;
6233;this is a real *hassle* i don't need right now;;;;
6234;"whatever happened to the old ""we'll get it right or you don't pay a dime!"" guarantee? does anyone still offer that in the appliance repair category? everyone wants a minimum charge for a service call whether they actually do anything or not";;;;
6235;what a sour taste that leaves in the customer's mind! take the money and run is no way to go through life folks!;;;;
6236;as always the 6 month checkup went very well;;;;
6237;brian was on time very knowledgeable and answered all questions with patience with both me and my husband;;;;
6238;highly recommend;;;;
6239;this review is difficult to write because it is so mixed;;;;
6240;the floral department is one of the best;;;;
6241;greg in the meat department is extremely helpful the management there is horrible;;;;
6242;the store certainly does not represent what safeway should stand for;;;;
6243;i live in goodyear part of the year and in san ramon california part of the year they have a state-of-the-art store in san ramon one which would rival any speciality grocery store so i know they can do it the one in goodyear is just horrible by conparison;;;;
6244;often the food is even old;;;;
6245;the people are generally nice but the management of safeway needs to do a major update here and fix this store;;;;
6246;amy is amazing and an outstanding example of going above and beyond;;;;
6247;i cannot thank her enough for taking the time out of her time off on a saturday to ensure we were taken care of;;;;
6248;my father in law passed away late friday june 2nd;;;;
6249;we went to the funeral home at 12 noon saturday june 3rd to make arrangements for his visitation funeral and graveside service;;;;
6250;we left after 2pm and went to another florist in the area that was a friend of the family;;;;
6251;"no offense to that florist her selections were slim pickings and she didn't seem too accommodating since she was low on fresh cut flowers because of ""prom weekend""";;;;
6252;"my wife was so upset because she wanted the perfect flower arrangement for her ""daddy""";;;;
6253;we began calling to realize that florist shut down and close shop early on saturdays;;;;
6254;i also know that sometimes a shop owner will still be around working even though the shop is closed;;;;
6255;i called talley's and left a message;;;;
6256;it was a shot in the dark;;;;
6257;my wife didn't want to wait until monday to figure this out when the visitation was scheduled for that evening;;;;
6258;after about 20 minutes of giving up my phone rang;;;;
6259;it was amy! she took the time to talk with us outside of business hours;;;;
6260;she was sympathetic and compassionate towards us and our circumstances;;;;
6261;we trusted her expertise and experience to provide us with an beautiful flower/plant combination;;;;
6262;we arrived to the funeral home monday evening and looked for the flower/plant arrangement;;;;
6263;wow! it was so beautiful! my wife started crying;;;;
6264;it was exactly why she wanted;;;;
6265;amy went above and beyond for us;;;;
6266;her expert knowledge combined with taking the time to listen to us to understand our wishes produced an amazing arrangement;;;;
6267;she is an example of what your floral experience should be;;;;
6268;we would recommend amy and talleys florist with full knowledge of how she interacts with actual customers;;;;
6269;i highly recommend this chandler crossroads me;;;;
6270;it's clean and inviting;;;;
6271;the front staff are very helpful polite and always have a smile on;;;;
6272;rooms are clean and welcoming;;;;
6273;there are plenty of therapists each with their own strengths and all very competent;;;;
6274;it took me a few therapists not that they weren't all very good to find the one for me;;;;
6275;ask for heather g but be prepared to book at least 3 weeks out if you want her;;;;
6276;yes she's worth it;;;;
6277;i always look forward to my next visit;;;;
6278;check this place out;;;;
6279;you'll leave relaxed and well taken care of;;;;
6280;the best there is! we interviewed several pool companies and talked to countless friends and coworkers about their pool building experiences;;;;
6281;we couldn't find one person who loved their pool builder;;;;
6282;we are happy to say we picked a winner! we found thunderbird by searching the internet we could not find a bad review and loved their website photos;;;;
6283;we scheduled an appt with les their designer;;;;
6284;les is wonderful;;;;
6285;he is the total opposite of your traditional pool salesman;;;;
6286;he took his time in listening to our needs and wants;;;;
6287;we had a challenge because we live on a large parcel of land and wanted the pool to be a focal point;;;;
6288;he drew a gorgeous design and continued to work with us until we loved both the plan and budget;;;;
6289;once we gave them the go it was so smooth i'm still in awe! cynthia called every few days to tell me the schedule when and whom would be in our yard;;;;
6290;every single person was on time and got their job done as scheduled;;;;
6291;our friends and family could not believe the speed and quality of our pool;;;;
6292;we've been finished about 5 weeks and absolutely love our pool! if your searching for an incredible pool and spa builder please do yourself a favor and call thunderbird;;;;
6293;we will continue to  share our recommendation to anyone else looking to build a pool;;;;
6294;my wife and i have been clients of dr;;;;
6295;tran and floss dental orthodontics since they opened their office on west cheyenne 9 years ago;;;;
6296;when we moved across to the southwest side of town we moved over to this location;;;;
6297;all of the dentists and staff are so professional and kind;;;;
6298;one of the most important things to my wife and i is a clean and sterile environment;;;;
6299;the office is immaculate and is completely up to date with all of the latest technologies;;;;
6300;we absolutely recommend this to all of our family and friends;;;;
6301;i wanted to david carradine with the lobster spaghetti;;;;
6302;nice place;;;;
6303;we were seated after a short wait on the patio;;;;
6304;if i remember correctly they had a water dispenser for those waiting;;;;
6305;place was packed;;;;
6306;seats were ok;;;;
6307;small menu;;;;
6308;there wasn't really a combo that did it for me;;;;
6309;a lot of good looking food on the daily special list problem is you'd have to come that specific day;;;;
6310;today's daily specials were steak and eggs and jalapeã±o hash thingy;;;;
6311;they just ran out of steaks i was told;;;;
6312;made the decision easier;;;;
6313;i got jalapeã±o hash thingy;;;;
6314;the food was ok;;;;
6315;it was well executed but nothing jumped out to me as being special or deserving of the hype;;;;
6316;would possibly go back if in the neighborhood more likely if a daily special was one that seemed exciting;;;;
6317;i'm not near matt's and there was nothing here that made it worth the drive;;;;
6318;we came here on super bowl sunday because we were visiting a friend who lived not far from this place;;;;
6319;when deciding on a place to watch the game a couple of friends suggested this casino because they had a big sports booking place and also because it wouldn't be as packed and crazy as the casinos on the strip;;;;
6320;this casino is about a 15-20 minute drive from the strip;;;;
6321;we were immediately greeted with the large screens in preparation for the super bowl;;;;
6322;they even had the volume turned up so that people in the area could listen;;;;
6323;they also had some tv's over the blackjack tables which was where we spent the second half watching the game;;;;
6324;there's also an aquarium and aquarium-themed restaurant in which they have a [fake] mermaid swimming in the aquarium and then people can take pictures with her afterwards;;;;
6325;there were tv's in the restaurant showing the super bowl as well;;;;
6326;and if you sign up for a players card you get a free buffet (which we didn't take advantage of though);;;;
6327;ok place overall;;;;
6328;but the sports book area was definitely a cool place to watch the game;;;;
6329;watch the game while playing penny slots and get free drinks!;;;;
6330;this place looks hopeful on the outside but is actually pretty bad;;;;
6331;my maple glazed salmon was very burnt and lacked flavor;;;;
6332;the asparagus it came with was pretty disgusting and soggy;;;;
6333;the waitress was great and the side caesar salad i had was good;;;;
6334;the experience was horrible simply due to the blasting crappy music as well;;;;
6335;probably don't eat here;;;;
6336;this little gem opened up a few month ago and it is run by the same people that have owned the amena cafe on sahara near o'bannon st;;;;
6337;"we started with the hummus ""tapas"" (their tapas are not the spanish variety of small servings of various culinary concoctions but dippings for pita bread which can be ordered as whole wheat or regular)";;;;
6338;the pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful;;;;
6339;the open face eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good;;;;
6340;there was more than enough for two meals;;;;
6341;i had never had shawarma before so i order the chicken and beef in the combo special;;;;
6342;"the chicken was spicy and the ""halal"" beef was tender and spiced perfectly";;;;
6343;the only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices;;;;
6344;this is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods;;;;
6345;if this is not a concern then have at their offers freely;;;;
6346;the dessert was magnificent;;;;
6347;an order of bakalava was heavenly and the kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  we had more than enough to take home for another meal;;;;
6348;the decor needs work to give this place a more intimate atmosphere as it was a pizza joint for many years but don't let that stop you from going in;;;;
6349;the chairs are not the standard plastic or wood bottoms and it wouldn't take much to get this place a little more elegant;;;;
6350;in the meantime go and see amer and get a taste sensation fix;;;;
6351;tell him nick sent you!;;;;
6352;omg so good!! i can't wait to go back!! love the atmosphere and the food was amazing (i had the eggplant);;;;
6353;this was one of my favorite culinary experience of my life! we didn't leave anything in our plate!!! thank you guys!!!;;;;
6354;everything was pretty good but the beef in the mongolian beef was very chewy and had a weird texture;;;;
6355;i know this is always a 50/50 chance when trying a new chinese restaurant;;;;
6356;the rest of the food was very good! their noodles are really good and the fried rice;;;;
6357;adult grilled cheese?  novel concept;;;;
6358;the food was good (not great);;;;
6359;the wait was long - prepare for a long wait this place is always packed!  the bread is quite greasy but the innards were excellent along with gigantic portions;;;;
6360;okay so we had a full meal here with drinks for less than $20;;;;
6361;can somebody say value?!;;;;
6362;we came here for brunch on a saturday around 10;;;;
6363;00 am and it was relatively full;;;;
6364;we ordered;;;;
6365;the malaysian curry chicken with rice ($6;;;;
6366;50) the malaysian street style sandwich ($5;;;;
6367;99) soy milk tea ($1;;;;
6368;80) and the hot honey lemon juice ($1;;;;
6369;80);;;;
6370;the malaysian curry was delicious but really really oily (you could literally see the pools of oil gathering on top of the bowl);;;;
6371;if you're fine with that (which i was) you'll probably still enjoy it;;;;
6372;the sandwich was our highlight - it really filling but still super light and tasty (the bread was white toast crispy and buttered);;;;
6373;it was stuffed with everything it promised but it didn't make you feel gross afterwards;;;;
6374;with the tea it was a great comforting saturday morning meal!;;;;
6375;located right beside the erindale go station in the same plaza as sushi tei chili chicken house and wonton chai noodle (among others) on the northwest corner of creditview and burnhamthorpe and a few minutes away from the mavis exit of highway 403 this place really gives you bang for your buck;;;;
6376;plus the food is delicious prepared fresh;;;;
6377;overall a really enjoyable meal;;;;
6378;our total with tax was around $18;;;;
6379;with tip we paid around $21;;;;
6380;a great go-to cheap eat in mississauga where the food is actually decent! will be back;;;;
6381;i really don't know how to rate this place;;;;
6382;i came for brunch on a sunday at 12;;;;
6383;30 with a reservation;;;;
6384;side note;;;;
6385;awesome that this place takes brunch reservations;;;;
6386;more places should start doing that;;;;
6387;but back to my review;;;;
6388;so i came at 12;;;;
6389;30 with my boyfriend and we promptly ordered a caesar a bellini an order of donuts the duck scramble and the two egg breakfast;;;;
6390;yes we're fatsos at heart;;;;
6391;the drinks came in a timely manner as did the donuts;;;;
6392;then we waited;;;;
6393;and waited;;;;
6394;and waited;;;;
6395;and waited;;;;
6396;and waited;;;;
6397;we are by no means slow eaters and we didn't stick around for very long after finishing our food but we didn't leave this restaurant until close to 3pm! it was quite absurd how long our main dishes took to arrive;;;;
6398;definitely unimpressed with the service;;;;
6399;as for the food itself i'd call it 'decent';;;;
6400;the donuts were delicious but the chocolate mousse-like dip it came with was rather tasteless;;;;
6401;actually i actively didn't like the chocolate dip and i love chocolate;;;;
6402;my duck scramble was good but nothing special;;;;
6403;i loved the potatoes but everything else just;;;;
6404;normal;;;;
6405;honestly the best part about this place in my opinion is that it takes brunch reservations;;;;
6406;i like the decor inside and it's apparently a very popular drink spot but i probably won't be back for brunch unless all i want is an order of potatoes and a bellini;;;;
6407;best chinese food in lkn area;;;;
6408;never disappointed with the take out we get;;;;
6409;they speak english well too!;;;;
6410;we order from this pizza hut often and always order a very similar order a stuff crust pizza with chicken bacon and onion on half;;;;
6411;we ordered today and the pizza had onion on the whole thing;;;;
6412;the manager was rude and didn't want to replace the pizza;;;;
6413;after telling him i will come in and talk to the store manager did he change his attitude toward the situation;;;;
6414;price was good service was professional  quality is outstanding;;;;
6415;these guys are connected to the guys at toronto t's;;;;
6416;i could not be happier with both of their services i use them regularly and would not hesitate to recommend them;;;;
6417;excellent chaat okish biriyani great service;;;;
6418;fresh food;;;;
6419;the place is very clean and lively;;;;
6420;unlike the other indian restaurant s we visited which were so dead!;;;;
6421;flies on the pizza that was sitting out there;;;;
6422;very disgusting;;;;
6423;i would not recommend it;;;;
6424;very unsanitary!;;;;
6425;although i have had a few problems with the front desk staff  i love this place because of my doctor;;;;
6426;he is the nicest most caring sweet attentive doctor i've ever seen!  i don't know what i would do without him!  michael tucker is the best! !!!;;;;
6427;i love it! almost all options are available in a vegan version;;;;
6428;yum!;;;;
6429;i am moving and am so sad i will not longer be able to come here;;;;
6430;so i made one last trip today;;;;
6431;i hope they consider expanding so i can enjoy the yummy items here once again;;;;
6432;got a pepperoni and sausage half sheet pizza from here last weekend and it was delicious;;;;
6433;the pepperoni was awesome! the sausage pieces are huge like small meatballs;;;;
6434;the sauce is thick and sweet which i like;;;;
6435;tons of cheese on this pizza which caused me to have an upset stomach aftward;;;;
6436;not their fault;;;;
6437;i didn't go into the building to pick up the pizza so i can't say what it's like to eat in;;;;
6438;there's a lot to like about crepe bar;;;;
6439;"it feels ""cool"" inside with an independent vibe that's a valuable commodity in suburban phoenix";;;;
6440;it's bustling and noisy inside which i enjoy but may be a negative to some;;;;
6441;the crepes are reasonably priced and they come with a salad and an unexpected appetizer portion of granola;;;;
6442;the crepes were good but not excellent and the portions were a little smaller than expected;;;;
6443;unfortunately during peak times you can expect a difficult time finding a seat and a long wait for your food;;;;
6444;also the options for non-pork eaters such as myself were limited;;;;
6445;this place is ideal for killing time sipping coffee on a weekend but not for much else;;;;
6446;being a big laguna hills ohop fan i was disappointed when i visited the scottsdale az location;;;;
6447;it felt like a completely different restaurant;;;;
6448;first off--cash only;;;;
6449;wasn't ready for that;;;;
6450;luckily they have an atm onsite;;;;
6451;secondly they really nerfed the size of the dutch baby here;;;;
6452;i worked up my friends at how awesome and overwhelmingly large the dutch baby is (and that you could share it with two people) but it was a disappointment;;;;
6453;it was bit dry almost burnt and stale tasting;;;;
6454;third i felt very rushed;;;;
6455;i know that there is a long line but they were really pushy about cleaning up our plates immediately after we finished and it made for an uncomfortable eating experience;;;;
6456;all in all there is little to distinguish this place from an ihop;;;;
6457;greasy unappetizing fried food;;;;
6458;low quality ingredients;;;;
6459;pretty much tastes all the same;;;;
6460;never again;;;;
6461;cheap tickets awful staff probably a good idea they got the self serve kiosks;;;;
6462;the remodel is nice but doesn't make up for the lousy customer service and rude popcorn makers;;;;
6463;my search for the best beautician with great customer service skills  hairstylist and applying my weaves are over;;;;
6464;rasheen's skills surpassed my expectations;;;;
6465;rasheen's expertise in the use of different techniques that would be best for your natural hair when applying your weave shows that she cares about your natural hair;;;;
6466;my hair looks amazing and i have received so many compliments;;;;
6467;second time i have been here  and the only reason i took a star away  was because i had to toss my entire takeout dish except the cookie!! i very specifically made sure to say no beans;;;;
6468;unfortunately  my food was covered in them!  the service here is very very good;;;;
6469;they know their menu and will walk you through finding the order right for you;;;;
6470;the food is very good  was looking forward to it;;;;
6471;looks like totinos is lunch today!!;;;;
6472;i've heard great things about toast for breakfast and lunch so thought we might get it a try for dinner;;;;
6473;we walked in around 6;;;;
6474;30pm on a friday night  the restaurant was about half filled;;;;
6475;there were plenty of seats in the the front of the restaurant but our party of four was seated in the very back beside the bathrooms and back door;;;;
6476;we sat there for a few minutes (not wanting to be difficult or affecting the order in which the servers were sat)  but  we really couldn't take the cold draft from the back patio door and constant bathroom visits;;;;
6477;we politely ask if we could move to the front;;;;
6478;the hostess obliged but didn't seem too happy about it;;;;
6479;the same server continued to wait on us once we sat in the front (we were glad because we did not want to make him lose a table);;;;
6480;we were brought a loaf of soft bread to table pretty tasty but the butter is a little different;;;;
6481;it is a sweet butter with orange zest;;;;
6482;we were told they were out of the ricotta ravioli (the dish i happened to be eyeing) but was told they can substitute the mushroom ravioli;;;;
6483;i ordered the mushroom ravioli  my husband the lasagna our friends ordered the chicken pot pie (all white meat) and chicken marsala with ravioli side;;;;
6484;the server came back out and told us there was only enough ravioli for one of us;;;;
6485;so my friend changed his order to the green beans and mashed potato side;;;;
6486;when our  meals came out they served him ravioli he was told by the server they found some ravioli in the back- um okay would have been nice to know before he got his meal as he was already looking forward to eating the dish he thought he ordered;;;;
6487;he was served a 2 mushroom ravioli and 1 ricotta (which he said was much better than the mushroom);;;;
6488;i was told by my friends that the chicken marsala and chicken pot pie were good;;;;
6489;my husband's lasagna was good but very rich!! i could only eat a couple bits he couldn't finish it;;;;
6490;my mushroom ravioli was bland and tasteless;;;;
6491;the cream sauce was very watery;;;;
6492;i did not enjoy my main dish at all;;;;
6493;on the bright side though we all got salads and really enjoyed them;;;;
6494;i had the small blue wedge salad;;;;
6495;it was a large portion with fresh cooked crispy bacon on top;;;;
6496;really good!;;;;
6497;our server disappeared  while we were eating our meal;;;;
6498;the lady who had been refilling our waters took over our table and closed our checks;;;;
6499;as we were leaving we see our server  sitting behind the bar playing on his phone and chatting with other guests;;;;
6500;we probably will not be returning to toast for dinner;;;;
6501;it just seemed way to pretentious and we were not impressed by the food or the 93;;;;
6502;5 sanitation grade;;;;
6503;this is always a must visit on vegas trips;;;;
6504;i've had the st;;;;
6505;louis crepe (ham and cheese) and nutella (peanut butter and banana);;;;
6506;yumm this place is consistently delicious every time;;;;
6507;the 20 minute wait is worth it for these crepes just try and find a table early on since the seating is shared with the cafã© next door;;;;
6508;seems a little pricey at about $10 but what isn't pricey in vegas?;;;;
6509;the turnhouse grille has what a lot of restaurants in charlotte are missing;;;;
6510;personality and memorable food! turnhouse is locally owned and staffed with people who genuinely want to be there to make your experience memorable;;;;
6511;john and katie regularly tend bar and and will amaze you with their creativity homemade bitters and signature drinks and sam is there to greet you with her smile and knowledge of the menu;;;;
6512;the food and is simply spectacular and the kitchen staff is spot-on with their creations and presentation;;;;
6513;my favorites eats are the shrimp burger the hef wings salmon blt and the pork chop;;;;
6514;i'd wake up from a coma to eat that shrimp burger!!! simply delicious and friendly place to hang out with friends;;;;
6515;extremely friendly staff;;;;
6516;smaller seating area than most nekter juice bars but that has been no problem;;;;
6517;always get my custom order correct;;;;
6518;no issues;;;;
6519;love location! conveniently close to physical therapy clinic where i run on antigravity treadmill & blocks from my obgyn's office;;;;
6520;ample parking;;;;
6521;used eat24 take out;;;;
6522;great pizza;;;;
6523;wings are good;;;;
6524;we'll worth it;;;;
6525;i will be using them over the hut in the future;;;;
6526;yoli's is a a great place to have breakfast;;;;
6527;the staff is wonderful and you always receive great customer service;;;;
6528;the prices are great the food is wonderful and the portion size leaves you quite full;;;;
6529;i usually can't finish my meal and end up with a nice snack for later;;;;
6530;"if you looking for the good customer service stay away from this restaurant the lady work from here never say hi to the customer i went this restaurant yesterday i was so surprised her rude attitude to customer i asked her to about seat and she said ""just go seat any where!"" i still dont know why she answer me with harsh tone voice";;;;
6531;when scheduling for your cleaning ask for miss julia;;;;
6532;she's great!;;;;
6533;im giving this place four stars more for sentiment than taste but their food is decent;;;;
6534;the falafel and gyro sandwiches are both on the small side but tasty and made in a flash;;;;
6535;they have basic middle eastern groceries as well as a few hot dishes and classic desserts such as baklava and cashew fingers;;;;
6536;a great place to get feta dolmas  tabouli or hummus;;;;
6537;the baba ganouj is excellent;;;;
6538;worst experience i've ever had with dr;;;;
6539;torres i found out i was pregnant in july  but ended up  having a miscarriage in september;;;;
6540;few appointments that i had with him he was very cold shouldered and i didn't feel he was really listening to what i had to say about my pregnancy that far;;;;
6541;apparently after my 1st blood tests my estrogen was low so he prescribed me progesterone 100 milligrams once a day;;;;
6542;things didn't work out so come end of september i ended up scheduling a d&c;;;;
6543;at that appointment he expressed that i probably have an estrogen issue since this was my 2nd miscarriage;;;;
6544;he didn't know that by now????? smh;;;;
6545;already frustrated with this location & this doc i was told i had to get went a follow-up;;;;
6546;i did & he didn't even check me (didn't undress) he only asked me a few questions anything wrong if i was trying to get pregnant again right away if i want birth control pills and that was prety much the end of the visit;;;;
6547;this doc didn't seem to care about my well being and didn't care enough to take better precautions with my blood results;;;;
6548;oh & while he was asking me questions before my surgery he answered a personal call in front of me;;;;
6549;he was talking about his hurt hip a trip aka vacation that he feels better now & he got rest;;;;
6550;then slowly walked out of my room;;;;
6551;horrible!!! the waiting time for this location is 2hrs plus;;;;
6552;i would not go to this location!!!!!;;;;
6553;this is my favorite place to go for sushi because of the ambiance service and overall quality of the menu items;;;;
6554;the ambiance is welcoming (literally with the chefs and servers acknowledging every patron's entrance with a warm greeting as per japanese tradition) and it never gets too busy or over-crowded so there's no reason to awkwardly wait around ever;;;;
6555;it's a good place for a first date not only because sushi's romantic like that but because it's never too startlingly quiet or loud;;;;
6556;there's just enough going on in this restaurant to keep everyone interested without being obnoxiously distracting;;;;
6557;since the space isn't very large there's usually only one server on duty but they always somehow manage to be attentive to all tables;;;;
6558;one thing out of the ordinary is that i've always had to ask for the bill or pay directly at the cashier;;;;
6559;if not i could be waiting for hours before my server would offer to bring it over;;;;
6560;the fish is always fresh and inventive;;;;
6561;my favorite is the sashimi salad;;;;
6562;it's my all time favorite the vinaigrette is a perfect tartness in contrast with thin strips of salmon tuna octopus and mackerel;;;;
6563;i could eat it forever;;;;
6564;other menu items are always cute and beautifully presented;;;;
6565;there are even local nods to the flames with the 'red mile roll,' and 'red hot flames rolls;;;;
6566;i give sushi dining chopsticks a 5-star rating for being an overall awesome dinner destination;;;;
6567;they changed their prices;;;;
6568;one star because the girl at the counter was sweet;;;;
6569;i used to get the grilled chicken pasta for 9;;;;
6570;00 and now it's 15;;;;
6571;00! i can't afford to go back;;;;
6572;i think loyalty supercedes trying to make an extra buck;;;;
6573;be loyal to your customers and they will return;;;;
6574;i would have been sympathetic to a dollar more but that's too high a jump;;;;
6575;the pasta is good but not olive garden in california  great;;;;
6576;i'll never understand why food tastes better in cali;;;;
6577;there are some mixed reviews here about fresh and from a food creativity standpoint i can appreciate that on some of the menu items;;;;
6578;however you're getting what you came for and that's what matters to me;;;;
6579;a mainstay for meal options when i'm traveling fresh has fresh bowls juices and more;;;;
6580;yes it might just be rice and steamed greens but their sauces enhance everything;;;;
6581;when i come for healthy vegan food that's all i really want;;;;
6582;i don't care for the vegetables to be made into unrecognizable too small creative portions;;;;
6583;with that being said fresh still has some interesting spins on their menus most notably the quinoa onion rings which are out of this world! and their homemade hot sauce is equally as good (i finish half the jar with every meal);;;;
6584;i just wish there was somewhere like this in calgary;;;;
6585;only my second maybe third time in life in outback;;;;
6586;i came late because that's how i roll;;;;
6587;i really don't enjoy a crowd;;;;
6588;headed straight for the bar which was pleasantly open;;;;
6589;kayla was my bartender made me a flavored ice tea because i didn't want water or regular unsweetened ice tea;;;;
6590;cheers to that and then she made the the huckleberry moonshine cocktail only 140 calories;;;;
6591;my meal was a 11oz center cut steak sweet potato and brocoli and cheese;;;;
6592;all the food was deliciously seasoned;;;;
6593;i'll be back;;;;
6594;just fulfilled a bucket list item and got my nose pierced!! this shop is beautiful!! so clean!! the staff is super friendly;;;;
6595;i was nervous but the piercer calmed me down with his sense of humor;;;;
6596;great place!!! it's so nice to have a quality shop on the westside;;;;
6597;decent dim sum but it's expensive;;;;
6598;a pot of tea costs money and they automatically add the gratuity to the bill;;;;
6599;take the walk up to dundas and spadina for better prices;;;;
6600;love this place! it's simple;;;;
6601;it's priced fair and the waffle was very good;;;;
6602;sunday was my day to say i have had enough of the twigs and berries and i want pancakes! well at least a waffle although they have big banner that states now serving pancakes but really who goes to a waffle cafe for pancakes;;;;
6603;the name tells you what their specialty is;;;;
6604;anyway i had a waffle with blueberries strawberries and bananas;;;;
6605;no i passed on the chocolate chips whipped cream and powdered sugar;;;;
6606;hey i was breaking lose on my food choices but didn't want to go crazy;;;;
6607;maybe that why i was carving ribs later that night because i knew i had saved some food karma points;;;;
6608;also the staff in this place was very friendly helpful and fun;;;;
6609;it was good to hear youthful energy enjoying their work instead of the normal this is just my job type of employee's;;;;
6610;this staff gave good service and enjoyed what they do;;;;
6611;i would definitely come back here good food good service and fair prices;;;;
6612;oh and i forgot to mention they also have cool smoothies i got the lychee;;;;
6613;yum i love the fruit!;;;;
6614;good food all around;;;;
6615;the meal begins with complimentary sides as most korean restaurants are known for;;;;
6616;in addition to the usual sprouts kimchi etc;;;;
6617;island style also gives you boiled peanuts which were a nice touch;;;;
6618;i went wth cold noodles half and half for my meal;;;;
6619;i really liked the dish with each side offering a nice taste;;;;
6620;i wish it could have been spicier but in the end i was contently full and very happy with my choice;;;;
6621;$14 for the dining experience was well worth it;;;;
6622;the restaurant itself had a very mom and pop feel and seemed authentic in every aspect;;;;
6623;a very good option for eating in the area;;;;
6624;i swear if the serving size was more this place could be a easy 4 1/2 stars;;;;
6625;my husband and i along with our boys were in sc last weekend for scheduled maintenance on one of our suv's and since the appointment was so early we rushed out without breakfast so of course the entire time in the waiting area we were searching for food;;;;
6626;this place was bookmarked by me so we went to check it out after seeing the menu had vegan options and our boys and i are vegan;;;;
6627;we arrived and boy was this place busy people standing outside waiting for tables and all;;;;
6628;i went in to see how the list worked and there was a sheet of paper on the landing with no one manning it and several sets of people in the extremely small (6ppl capacity) entry way;;;;
6629;i flagged down a server who then came to take my name and others waiting name down and explained to us all at once how the long table in the middle worked;;;;
6630;basically the table is 1st come 1st served and adding your name to the list put you on wait for the tables around the room on the outer perimeter;;;;
6631;we were told 30min so we sat in the car and my husband went inside every 10mins to see if we were coming up since they don't take numbers nor do they have buzzers;;;;
6632;i totally don't mind this process at all it seems more down to earth and not commercial;;;;
6633;after about 40 plus minutes we got a table and were so hungry and i ordered the chef special vegan dish which was the only vegan dish on the list;;;;
6634;i was immediately told that the chef special was sold out and that happened about a half hour before i ordered (meaning if we had a seat i wouldn't got to have it );;;;
6635;mind you it was only like 11;;;;
6636;30am *insert kanye shrug*;;;;
6637;i read on the specials menu that there was a skillet with lots of yummy veggies that i enjoy and some type of meat i asked if the skillet could be made for me minus the meat;;;;
6638;the waitress agreed so that's what i ordered;;;;
6639;my husband ordered a veggie egg while omelet dish with a sweet potato waffle;;;;
6640;our toddler had pancakes and fruit;;;;
6641;look i'm honest so here is the run down on what you we had;;;;
6642;skillet (cauliflower squash sweet potato & red peppers) - this  we super tasty but extremely small;;;;
6643;egg white omelet with veggies(goid);;;;
6644;sweet potato waffle - hubby wasn't impressed he stated it was to soft and the texture wasn't what he expected;;;;
6645;we look forward to checking out other items and won't come hungry;;;;
6646;awesome breakfast!!! had the rubin benedict and wow was it good! loved it!! kid friendly & mom approved  in fact she had the florentine benedict;;;;
6647;good service and prices;;;;
6648;wow! i had the new nexgen technique instead of the old gel nail method and i luv it! tommy did a great job;;;;
6649;no more harsh chemicals and horrible soaking in that poison!  everyone should try it;;;;
6650;i totally recommend it;;;;
6651;absolutely amazing;;;;
6652;think chipotle for enchiladas;;;;
6653;nice patio plenty of room inside;;;;
6654;the food is really amazing;;;;
6655;the prices are great;;;;
6656;if you're not in the area it's actually worth the trip;;;;
6657;i ordered 2 chicken enchiladas;;;;
6658;i'll be back to try the tacos!;;;;
6659;we love barnes and noble but this store does not deserve to carry the name;;;;
6660;it's a terrible representation and if barnes and noble cares anything about their brand reputation they should get to this story immediately and clean it up!  please start in the bathrooms!  horrendous!;;;;
6661;"""i would give the location 5 stars and the restaurant 3 so we're at 4 stars overall";;;;
6662;i went with hubski and a couple of friends for a nice weekend picnic;;;;
6663;the experience would have been a 5-star one if we had brown-bagged it but as it was we purchased food from the quaint little house-converted-to-restaurant;;;;
6664;hubski and i shared a veggie sandwich and a peach pie thing;;;;
6665;tasty but most definitely overpriced;;;;
6666;the iced tea was tasty and refreshing but still sharing a meal with a drink each it should have been less money;;;;
6667;i'll go back for the ambiance;;;;
6668;it's definitely kid and dog friendly but we'll bring a big blanket some kid toys a dog or three and lunch in a brown bag;;;;
6669;we'll still buy pastries though;;;;
6670;as far a dunkin donut locations i have been to better;;;;
6671;it's close to where i am staying for my birthday week and i have the app with a few free coffee rewards;;;;
6672;that is the main reason i came to this location 2 days in a row;;;;
6673;first day there was no line but i had to wait since i ordered a smoothie that apparently only one person knew how to make;;;;
6674;and of course they were busy;;;;
6675;day two i decided to go simple and got a large coffee with two donuts;;;;
6676;coffee order was right but they gave me the wrong donuts;;;;
6677;"my husband and i drove by rani's a couple weeks ago and he said ""international market? that looks interesting";;;;
6678;"""  so i made a note to check it out on yelp later";;;;
6679;"after reading the reviews i channeled liz lemon and exclaimed ""$6 vegetarian indian food? i want to go to there!""";;;;
6680;so that is how we wound up at rani's;;;;
6681;i immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha (i'm a sucker for paneer) and the cute lil lady behind the counter proceeded to give me an indian sweet to have while i waited;;;;
6682;she brought out our thali which consisted of 2 roti rice dal pickles okra an aloo-gobi-type yumminess and i believe kofta (veggie dumplings);;;;
6683;the cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave us a tomato soup with paneer in it;;;;
6684;definite bonus points;;;;
6685;everything was fantastic although i was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha;;;;
6686;this place is very casual which i really like about it;;;;
6687;don't come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit-down indian restaurant;;;;
6688;instead expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma's kitchen;;;;
6689;after we filled our bellies we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery store;;;;
6690;i hadn't planned on buying anything but when i found garam masala for super cheap and black salt that i had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6-$12 for a tiny jar anywhere else);;;;
6691;well you get the picture;;;;
6692;anything you would need for a well-stocked indian pantry is here and then some;;;;
6693;there's also mint and tamarind sauces bottled lassis naan and huge blocks of paneer;;;;
6694;trust me when i say i seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home;;;;
6695;i considered giving this place 4 stars because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time;;;;
6696;but it was a friday evening and there was an indian soap opera on the tv i think we interrupted;;;;
6697;so obviously i can't blame them;;;;
6698;i remember coming to the buffet at the bellagio several years ago for sunday champagne brunch and being blown away;;;;
6699;it was one of the best brunches i had ever eaten;;;;
6700;alas my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression;;;;
6701;i brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet i remembered;;;;
6702;well we got off to a bad start;;;;
6703;my son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and i carried him into the restaurant;;;;
6704;at the register i discovered that there was no children's price and that i would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child;;;;
6705;because it was mom's birthday i went with it but i was annoyed;;;;
6706;no child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food;;;;
6707;they want the pizza and dessert and not much else;;;;
6708;of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything so i paid for him to sit there and be cranky;;;;
6709;my bad;;;;
6710;as for the adult meals the food was fine;;;;
6711;i had prime rib which was only ok but the mashed potatoes were awesome;;;;
6712;my mother had the crab legs which she loved;;;;
6713;we must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last;;;;
6714;the waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water;;;;
6715;really the food was pretty good so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal  but i just can't help but feel like we over paid;;;;
6716;there was nothing remarkable offered;;;;
6717;the service was iffy the food was unexceptional;;;;
6718;well dessert was pretty great but i don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert;;;;
6719;i'm just not feeling the love for this place this time;;;;
6720;we got the chicken club and the prime rib dip!!! french fries and side salad!! it was yummy!!!!!!;;;;
6721;) only problem was not a kids menu;;;;
6722;they will make a few items for the kids!!! the chicken tenders;;;;
6723;the kids did not like them;;;;
6724;not your normal kid friendly kid coating!!!;;;;
6725;awful awful people! i'm only giving them one star because i can't post otherwise but they're not even worth that;;;;
6726;i used movingapt;;;;
6727;com to find them - won't ever use them again either;;;;
6728;i thought having an agent would prevent this kind of crap from happening;;;;
6729;i don't even know where to start with my complaints;;;;
6730;this entire move was a mess from the beginning due to lack of communications and professionalism;;;;
6731;i paid extra for a specific move date and time as well as a 'special handling fee' because of my piano;;;;
6732;when they arrive for the pick-up - 2 days late 6 hours after they were supposed to be there - they didn't come prepared for a piano;;;;
6733;my dad and uncle had to find 2x4's to use as a ramp and help the movers hold it and roll it off the porch;;;;
6734;this is a stage piano the wheels aren't really meant for rolling around cement! after loading everything and telling my parents they were headed my way (virginia) my stuff is taken from wyoming to seattle then back to vegas where it was put in storage without my knowledge or permission;;;;
6735;i only found out because i kept calling to see the whereabouts of the truck so i could plan accordingly;;;;
6736;after repeated phone calls and finally the threat of legal action my items were put back on a truck and started the journey east;;;;
6737;finally they call to tell me they'll be there on june xx which is exactly during the 3-day window i said i would be out of the state and not be able to receive the truck - again all covered before the contract was even signed;;;;
6738;so i'm told if i can't get a friend to meet them at my house and let them in they'd go on to new york with my stuff and i'd have to pay an additional fee to get it whenever they brought it back to me which would be at their discretion;;;;
6739;luckily i was able to get a hold of someone and coordinate with them to receive the shipment upon which he started taking pictures the moment the truck was opened;;;;
6740;(see below);;;;
6741;after they had unloaded everything and after i had confirmed 3 times over the course of this month that they had the proper equipment they realize that in fact they don't have anything to move the piano;;;;
6742;so they decide they'll go to home depot hire random men and carry/lift the piano into my house;;;;
6743;you don't lift a piano! so my friend that's there says no it's too heavy you need the proper equipment i suggest you go find it;;;;
6744;so then they tell him that they need to get on the road to new york for their next job so they'll just go put my piano in a warehouse until i was back so i'd let them deliver it;;;;
6745;again they're told no at which point the driver calls me while i'm in the airport and says if i don't let them into my house i'd have to pay a second delivery fee;;;;
6746;i told them not to leave the state with my piano and i'd call them right back - so i call my friend and ask what's going on;;;;
6747;he gives me the scoop;;;;
6748;i asked him if he'd run up the street - about 4 blocks from my house - and secure a storage unit that these guys could back the truck right up to the ramp get the piano on a dolly and store it there for two days til i could get a professional;;;;
6749;he said ok and while i'm still on the phone i hear him say exactly that to the driver;;;;
6750;i call the driver back myself and say the same thing;;;;
6751;i literally asked them to wait 15 minutes while we got this taken care of;;;;
6752;he said ok;;;;
6753;my friend leaves gets the paperwork for a storage unit comes back and these guys have unloaded the piano rolled it down the sidewalk (no dolly) tried to lift it up my 4 steps dropped it eventually go it inside and we're running to their truck when my friend gets back;;;;
6754;they hadn't given him the inventory sheets or had him sign anything so he hollers at them and runs after;;;;
6755;he had to jump in his own vehicle to chase them down and cut them off before they stopped;;;;
6756;at that point they gave him the paperwork - still not signed - and took off again;;;;
6757;as soon as i got home that same evening i went right to the piano to take a look and started taking pictures;;;;
6758;i called the driver and asked what had happened;;;;
6759;he said nothing everything was fine no damage;;;;
6760;i called bs and told him i'm standing in my living room looking at the damage;;;;
6761;he hung up and i've never been able to get a hold of these people since;;;;
6762;i just moved from new york to charlotte and was having a hard time finding a threading salon decide to give this place a shot and i am very happy with the results! customer service was spectacular reasonably priced and very satisfied with how my eyebrows look;;;;
6763;will definitely be coming back and recommend for anyone! once you thread your eyebrows you will never want to wax them ever again;;;;
6764;my kids had an absolutely blast playing here! lots of fun! my only suggestion would be more comfortable seating for the parents;;;;
6765;the more comfortable the parents are the longer the kids can stay & play;;;;
6766;very nice little casual eatery;;;;
6767;intimate setting but very flavorful dishes;;;;
6768;i tried the chicken shwarma and it was delicious;;;;
6769;great prices and the service was reasonably quick as well;;;;
6770;i normally don't like fancy cupcakes because they consist of half icing in volume and i'm not a big fan of frosting--it's too much like eating heavy creamy sugar;;;;
6771;this place however has light and fluffy icing that i actually looked forward to biting into all on its own;;;;
6772;amazing;;;;
6773;2015 st;;;;
6774;patrick's day festival highlights;;;;
6775;saturday morning parking was available for free at 1) parking garage near city hall located at basic road and lead street;;;;
6776;accessed from basic road and 2) parking garage near justice facility located at water street near basic road;;;;
6777;accessed from either water street or texas avenue;;;;
6778;a must see is the  carrolier academy of irish dance! the children participated in the parade and scheduled events throughout the weekend;;;;
6779;led by debbie carroll and shelley locklier the two dancers have irish dance teaching credentials;;;;
6780;both teachers travelled the world with michael flatley's lord of the dance;;;;
6781;fun for the children included the ferris wheel and carousel;;;;
6782;since the las vegas valley does not have a permanent ferris wheel and carousel to ride we enjoyed taking a twirl on both;;;;
6783;ferris wheel tickets were 4 tickets per person;;;;
6784;carousel tickets were 3 per person but an adult is free if standing next to small children who are on the ride;;;;
6785;each ticket = $1;;;;
6786;i would like to see a greater use of food trucks;;;;
6787;we saw pizza mexican filipino hot dogs cupcakes and snowcones;;;;
6788;come on las vegas valley food culture come out and show us what you offer;;;;
6789;everytime i'm in town i hit this place for curds beer and brats;;;;
6790;i spent a whole sunday watching football here and had a blast;;;;
6791;crowded times are a little annoying but it is a college place;;;;
6792;love the mustard selections too;;;;
6793;curds are a must!;;;;
6794;give me someone who can make me laugh;;;;
6795;and i'll be your friend for life;;;;
6796;i'm a big fan of the comedy zone;;;;
6797;they are having a killer year with shows;;;;
6798;kudos to the crew there for bringing in such great talent and big names in 2013;;;;
6799;it's located below the saloon at the nc music factory;;;;
6800;"yes it feels like you are in someone's basement but not in a ""it rubs the lotion on its skin"" kind of way";;;;
6801;drinks are reasonably priced;;;;
6802;bottled water only;;;;
6803;the menu is your typical bar food but pretty decent bar food at that;;;;
6804;service is good;;;;
6805;i've yet to have a bad experience;;;;
6806;the venue set up is great;;;;
6807;there is seriously not a bad seat in the house;;;;
6808;you can pick yours online when you buy tickets;;;;
6809;the local opener will always be hit or miss;;;;
6810;the headliner(s) will be worth the price of admission;;;;
6811;if you're looking for something different to do i recommend checking the comedy zone calendar and catching a show;;;;
6812;my personal must-see list;;;;
6813;(i make sure to go every time these guys are in town);;;;
6814;bill burr (he sells out pretty much every time;;;;
6815;buy immediately when announced);;;;
6816;josh wolf (you know him from chelsea lately shark after dark);;;;
6817;pauly shore (warning;;;;
6818;filthy language);;;;
6819;i'm never disappointed picking up a slice at desert ridge slices - the kids love  it and i'm a fan of the nyc triangle slice too;;;;
6820;plus i pick up all my weekly magazine reads in their shop as well;;;;
6821;the reason i did not rate a 5 is because the staff is not the best with designs;;;;
6822;i like to have designs on my nails and they were very hesitant to do any of the ones i wanted;;;;
6823;they ended up doing a hawaiian flower on my toes;;;;
6824;its was ok but not the best;;;;
6825;i was very impressed by the cleanliness of the salon;;;;
6826;they have a large polish selection;;;;
6827;my nails have lasted a long time and that means a lot to me;;;;
6828;they were very friendly and humorous there! they all used english talking to patrons and with each other which was great!;;;;
6829;i think the prices were great for the waxhaw area;;;;
6830;i paid $57 (without tip) for a full set french manicure with sparkles and pedicure with design;;;;
6831;i used to pay $75 for the same service at my last salon;;;;
6832;i will definitely go here again;;;;
6833;i would recommend making an appointment;;;;
6834;it was a saturday when i went and they were turning people away;;;;
6835;love nicole;;;;
6836;she's a fabulous bartender;;;;
6837;always gives us great service;;;;
6838;love the wahoo salad with fish;;;;
6839;woke up earlier this week with a crazy case of torticollis;;;;
6840;couldn't turn my head to the right and i was having spasms like crazy! went to the joint on wednesday thursday and friday (today);;;;
6841;quick easy adjustments and i'm back to *almost* 100%;;;;
6842;today i mentioned offhand that i've had tmj for 3 weeks;;;;
6843;two seconds of adjustments and bam it's fixed! what the heck?! why didn't i ask about this before?!;;;;
6844;i signed up for the monthly program and i'll for sure be taking full advantage of it;;;;
6845;nice relatively new mesa gun shop in the old bank building w/the clock tower on main st;;;;
6846;good prices decent ammo inventory helpful knowledgeable friendly staff;;;;
6847;veteran owned with a modest veteran's discount on purchases;;;;
6848;my new favorite gunshop in the area;;;;
6849;excellent customer service! i want to thank omar in particular for his attention to detail and personal touch to making sure my car was serviced to the best of his ability;;;;
6850;as a customer he made me feel valued and special;;;;
6851;i can see why this business is always busy because i will definitely return and recommend this store to my friends and family;;;;
6852;i love my new tires and wheels from discount tire;;;;
6853;i have purchased potted herbs here before and have been less than impressed- gnats/root rot are commonly seen upon close inspection and i have to dig around to find a few to take home;;;;
6854;this place is a bit of a drive for me and i wanted to be sure they had what i needed in stock before i drove down on a hot day;;;;
6855;i called to ask about a specific kind of planter pot in stock waited about 5 minutes only to have my call picked up and ended;;;;
6856;i called back again and waited another 5 minutes for someone to tell me they had that type of pot in stock but couldn't give me any specifics on a general price point;;;;
6857;star nursery is pricier than other places such as amazon and home depot/lowe's;;;;
6858;"so when he told me they were ""pretty cheap"" i had to take it with a grain of salt";;;;
6859;my seedlings can wait a couple of days for an amazon shipment;;;;
6860;i can't patron this place this time around but maybe i'll continue to come back in the future;;;;
6861;i most definitely would recommend this place to anyone;;;;
6862;thanx to cake world my cake for my son's baby shower made the entire event that much better! i will be going back in the future!;;;;
6863;i have noticed when 2 guests come and sit on a 4-seating table the owner always makes it a point to move them saying that maybe there will be a lot of people who in and it will be a hassle to move them later so they shift to the smaller tables;;;;
6864;i consider it pretty rude to do that when almost all the tables are empty and in the 2 days i visited the restaurant was never completely full;;;;
6865;run run run!!! this is a sham up one side and down the other!! we rented an economy car like we have 40 times (we are locals);;;;
6866;we prepaid through carrentals;;;;
6867;com;;;;
6868;it clearly states on the agreement;;;;
6869;unlimited miles;;;;
6870;i drop my husband off to get our prepaid rental car from ez sleezy car rentals of las vegas! when hubby gets to the counter;;;;
6871;guess what;;;;
6872;she said you are locals;;;;
6873;you need to bring a bill from home to prove where you live;;;;
6874;and you only get 150 miles per day and you need to pay a big fat deposit and and and;;;;
6875;it clearly says on contract;;;;
6876;unlimited miles;;;;
6877;paid in full;;;;
6878;the rude b$tch at the counter was a horrible wench with a horrible attitude;;;;
6879;she was just a nasty person;;;;
6880;so my husband walked over to hertz;;;;
6881;rented a car;;;;
6882;paid and because it was in person they did a 200;;;;
6883;00 hold (which is fine) it was 20;;;;
6884;00 more for 1 day less than ez shit hole nasty car scam not rent al;;;;
6885;then on the contract it says no refunds no matter what;;;;
6886;seriously!?  they broke the contract but changing alllll the terms as a local;;;;
6887;they are very prejudice towards us;;;;
6888;"and we are a ""disabled vet marine"" and a ""business owner"" with a ""5 year old child "" with us";;;;
6889;stay away from this place;;;;
6890;what glitter here is not gold;;;;
6891;it is lie steal and cheat the customers;;;;
6892;go to anywhere other than this rip off place;;;;
6893;what a freaking nightmare!!! if you are local;;;;
6894;do not come here at all!!!  if you purchase online;;;;
6895;does not matter you are screwed;;;;
6896;plan on getting a car somewhere else and plan an additional chunk of money you wont have for your vacation!!  run run run;;;;
6897;unless you like the run around  getting ripped off and having nightmares;;;;
6898;we have used all the other companies there;;;;
6899;this is the only one we had a problem with;;;;
6900;it was the worst experience ever!!  this rental was april 2015;;;;
6901;this place is over the top! the food is great and the portions;;;;
6902;when the hell did every restaurant in vegas begin serving only sumo wrestlers;;;;
6903;my family had a great mix of food - the mayor of flavortown burger motley que sandwich and vegas fries;;;;
6904;don't kid yourself the fries aren't a side;;;;
6905;not by a long shot;;;;
6906;they are a meal and for $13 they're a very filling meal;;;;
6907;we all loved our food but i'll have to say the motley que was the best meal of the night;;;;
6908;damn it! my wife is always bragging about how she's better at ordering and she did it again here;;;;
6909;this place isn't inexpensive but the portions and quality make it well worth it;;;;
6910;we had dinner at burgr the night before and for the same $100 this is the better option by a long shot;;;;
6911;my only complaint is the hostess staff;;;;
6912;they treat you like crap - you're just a number to them;;;;
6913;they have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you;;;;
6914;next! when i asked about the wait after 45 minutes she told me that she texted me 6 minutes earlier;;;;
6915;i showed her my phone - no text;;;;
6916;well that also meant no apology from her either;;;;
6917;she gave me a look like do you still want in or not i have other people to be rude to;;;;
6918;food is good but service is always lacking;;;;
6919;35 minutes wait time for lunch is unacceptable especially when you only have an hour for lunch;;;;
6920;nice enough theatre but not a great overall experience;;;;
6921;only one person working the ticket counter at 7pm on a saturday night;;;;
6922;long line to get tickets meant standing outside in the sun;;;;
6923;no kiosks;;;;
6924;screen sound and chairs were good;;;;
6925;way too hot;;;;
6926;i've never walked out of a theatre with swamp ass before;;;;
6927;"10 mins of commercials prior to the ""start time"" followed by another 30 mins of previews";;;;
6928;talk about pinching pennies and squeezing every ounce of profit out of the movie experience;;;;
6929;i'd liken it to one of those free iphone games with adds running constantly;;;;
6930;cheap;;;;
6931;cheap;;;;
6932;i love the food at panera;;;;
6933;only thing about this place is the slow service;;;;
6934;staff behind the counter chit-chats with guests and doesn't seem to notice all the people waiting in line;;;;
6935;i seem to always wait in line during my hour break and i'm always rushing to eat to make it back to the office;;;;
6936;i also ordered a salad with no cheese but for some reason they always add cheese and i always have to return the food to get the order corrected and wait even longer;;;;
6937;tuesdays are 30% off seniors 60 and over;;;;
6938;that is a huge saving;;;;
6939;if i see something a few days before that i like and is still around tuesday it's an extra bonus;;;;
6940;you must tell the cashier you are a senior before cashing out or they  will not apply the discount;;;;
6941;transaction has to be voided and well;;;;
6942;so just tell them right away;;;;
6943;i like this location;;;;
6944;some of the house ware merchandise is pricey;;;;
6945;it makes no sense and needs to be addressed;;;;

6952;i was kind of upset that my previous dentist left;;;;
6953;i walked in one day for a medical visit and the whole office was different;;;;
6954;i wish they would have sent an email or something letting me know;;;;
6955;i like the new dr;;;;
6956;he explains everything and i have not had any issues with him;;;;
6957;the staff is really nice;;;;
6958;i hate the dentist and they make it easier to be there so i am thankful for them;;;;
6959;i like neon;;;;

6963;me? well i like a stiff drink and 70's decor;;;;
6964;somewhere in a previous life i wore nothing but polyester;;;;
6965;more like miami vice or maybe boogie nights;;;;
6966;either way environment is always friendly or intimate depending on what you wish;;;;
6967;you cant go wrong with a french 57 the mac and cheese is all sorts of nom nom and the tab for a night at kellys is something you can feel comfortable taking home even if you aren't taking anything else;;;;
6968;some notes;;;;
6969;restaurant is located in the esplandade with the amc cinema and to the east of the ritz carleton;;;;
6970;best bet is to park in the parking garage and then go to the walking mall;;;;
6971;even so it's tough to find;;;;
6972;don't give up;;;;
6973;also it is no longer fuego tacos but now fuego del mar with a seafood-centric menu;;;;
6974;that being said;;;;
6975;i was pretty edgy by the time we arrived;;;;
6976;we're from cave creek and had been out shopping and then had a heck of a time finding the place so we arrived about 8;;;;
6977;15---pretty close to closing;;;;
6978;and i had a groupon---and there are yelp reviews that said the staff doesn't like groupon-ers;;;;
6979;"greeted by guy that i assume is the gent someone described as ""xl""";;;;
6980;he's just a little round;;;;
6981;and was a warm welcoming fella;;;;
6982;he beamed a smile at us waved at dining room and told us to sit wherever we wanted;;;;
6983;we chose a cozy booth in the corner;;;;
6984;our server was there in moments with menus and take our drink orders;;;;
6985;i wish i remembered her name---dark hair in a pony-tail glasses and really personable and nice despite it being the end of the night and we were late-comers;;;;
6986;nice ambiance---exposed brick walls soft light great music---dh would have liked their playlist!;;;;
6987;trouble;;;;
6988;she hands us the menu;;;;
6989;except for one dish everything is seafood;;;;
6990;fuego tacos is now fuego del mar;;;;
6991;dh doesn't like fish and is semi-allergic to shellfish;;;;
6992;i asked if he wanted to leave and he said no we had gone thru too much to find the place---he would just order the one non-seafood dish;;;;
6993;at least he didn't have to make a lot of choices!  so dh ordered the pernil asada which was described as slow-cooked pork topped with mango-chile salsa;;;;
6994;his sides were the green chile-bacon hushpuppies and the latin succotash;;;;
6995;i ordered their signature dish of seafood chile rellenos---a poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp crab and tilapia in a lobster-tomato sauce with hush puppies and pineapple-serrano cole slaw;;;;
6996;for drinks dh got the house red and i got a pomegranate adult lemonade;;;;
6997;drinks arrived in less than 5 minutes;;;;
6998;dh very happy with something he thought would be bottom row plonk;;;;
6999;my adult lemonade was so delicious---i had to be careful!  i could have drank several of them;;;;
7000;it tasted like lemonade with a hint of fruit---but it definitely had alcohol in it!;;;;
7001;entrees arrived within 15 minutes of the drinks;;;;
7002;dh's was all on one plate;;;;
7003;three hush puppies latin succotash---which looked delish---and a mound of pork with the salsa;;;;
7004;not super pretty;;;;
7005;my presentation was much more beautiful---a mammoth poblano pepper in a puddle of light red sauce;;;;
7006;slaw and hush puppies on the side;;;;
7007;lovely presentation;;;;
7008;my only comment is that serving something in a bowl (albeit large) that needs to be cut is problematic;;;;
7009;i'd like to say how wonderful dh's meal was but basically i got one bite of his pork---that's all he would share---before he devoured it;;;;
7010;he said it was one of the best pork dishes he had ever enjoyed;;;;
7011;he felt like he was in the caribbean!  i got no bites of the succotash darn him---looked so good!  he scarfed it all!   his hush puppies went that fast too!;;;;
7012;was my seafood chile relleno the best thing ever?  no but it was very very good!  beautifully cooked not greasy  seafood not overcooked at all the lobster-tomato sauce was delicious;;;;
7013;again only quibble i have is serving it in a bowl;;;;
7014;it was a very deep bowl too---a smaller girl might have had trouble reaching in there but i am fairly tall and long-armed;;;;
7015;the hush puppies---shut my mouth darlin' but they were dang good!  lots of lovely bacon-y flavor a hint of heat and a touch sweet;;;;
7016;what is it with those yankees not adding a bit of sweet to their cornbread?  whoever made these knew what they were doing;;;;
7017;the pineapple-serrano cole slaw was in a citrus-y non-creamy dressing and the crispness the fruitiness and the heat was a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the relleno;;;;
7018;huge portion---i ended up bringing home half the relleno slaw and two hush puppies---lunch!  yum!  dh swined his plate so it's deli turkey for him hahaha!;;;;
7019;bonus---ended up talking to the gentleman in the booth next to us---so interesting;;;;
7020;he is a musician who's lived all over the us and the world---europe and the middle east;;;;
7021;really neat guy;;;;
7022;i wouldn't live in the city but i love visiting the city 'cause you meet the most interesting people!;;;;
7023;"so at the end i pulled out my groupon and gave it to our server apologizing that i had ""hid"" it until the end but that yelp reviews had indicated groupon-ers got short shift as far as service went";;;;
7024;she took it graciously with a smile and said one of the issues was when they were fuego tacos people ordered $9 plates than proferred a $10 groupon;;;;
7025;not nice;;;;
7026;(btw fuego del mar entrees from $20-$25);;;;
7027;for sure we will be back;;;;
7028;it's a field trip for us but worth it;;;;
7029;just an all-around good experience;;;;
7030;this was my first time going to harvey's;;;;
7031;i was so impressed! the service was wonderful;;;;
7032;the cook even came out to check to make sure we were enjoying our meal;;;;
7033;the burgers were the best burgers i have had since moving to phoenix;;;;
7034;the restaurant it's self is no thrills but i would recommend it to anyone is craving an incredible burger and great service;;;;
7035;bad experience;;;;
7036;there was something wrong with the temperature;;;;
7037;we were cold all the night as we couldn't even take of our coats;;;;
7038;i will never go there again unless i hear they have found a way to set up temperature of the room;;;;
7039;pretty big portions good for family style;;;;
7040;walnut shrimp's is 90% batter and 10% shrimp;;;;
7041;recommend the fish filet and jelly fish;;;;
7042;after getting into an arguement at another az casino with a fellow bj player i've decided that table poker is the game for me;;;;
7043;3 card poker specifically!!!   love going to the wild horse pass casino;;;;
7044;all the table dealers i've dealt with there are very friendly both when you're winning and losing;;;;
7045;"trust me i've seen my fair share of ""coolers"" who have been asshats in other casinos";;;;
7046;the dealer i had this past friday night was especially helpful to a friend of mine a newbie to 3 card and taught her the basics;;;;
7047;the 27/7 cafe has decent food;;;;
7048;though i think next time i'll just order a side of bacon and an order of sourdough toast instead of a club on sourdough;;;;
7049;the bacon they have there;;;;
7050;seriously;;;;
7051;awesome!;;;;
7052;finally;;;;
7053;many thanks to wild horse pass for having a $5min 3 card poker table on friday night!  and a big thank you to the dealer who dealt me the 3 of a kind and the straight flush!  cha ching!!  color up yo!;;;;
7054;not much to say about this;;;;
7055;shattered my iphone 5 screen brought it in and 25 minutes later we were back up and running;;;;
7056;got what i expected;;;;
7057;great repair;;;;
7058;excellent for take-out or delivery;;;;
7059;the food is authentic;;;;
7060;the ingredients are incredibly fresh - a necessity in thai cuisine;;;;
7061;the pad thai is perfect the green and red curries are consistent and delicious;;;;
7062;eating in however avoid it! the decor is dated and tacky not a pleasant environment to dine although the servers are all pleasant;;;;
7063;nice way to spend the morning;;;;
7064;relaxing by the pool enjoying breakfast at the terrace pointe cafã©;;;;
7065;service was great;;;;
7066;food was delicious;;;;
7067;please bring back the lobster eggs benedict & the wynn sunrise juice to the menu!!!;;;;
7068;wonderful fast service! received almost daily updates by phone and everything that needed to be done was confirmed by me beforehand! price estimate was very accurate and very do-able;;;;
7069;the folks at bell auto were very nice and understanding they worked well with my needs;;;;
7070;if ever i need anything done i'll be sure to return!;;;;
7071;definitely not the best looking places and the food was just ok;;;;
7072;crab rangoons were disgusting i couldn't even eat them and the chicken and broccoli was weird tasting the gravy was really thick and the rice wasn't the best i've ever had;;;;
7073;it took five minutes to be greeted and to order my food;;;;
7074;will i go back no!;;;;
7075;tacos were good service was good;;;;
7076;neither were great;;;;
7077;i've been here twice and i like the tacos and the sauce caddie;;;;
7078;oh my god why did you rate it so low? it's a mexican restaurant and they had nothing spicy;;;;
7079;nothing;;;;
7080;i asked and i was greeted with a shrug;;;;
7081;i asked other employees another shrug;;;;
7082;""" you mean you have no spicy salsa sauce nothing spicy!!!"" "" no sorry sir this is scottsdale""";;;;
7083;i'm not a spicy freak to be clear;;;;
7084;they don't have tabasco or anything even close to being hot;;;;
7085;"they have  ""habanero oil""";;;;
7086;"when i asked if it was hot the sever told me ""only if you think vegetable oil is hot cause that's what it is"" she was telling the truth";;;;
7087;literally! i'll pass next time;;;;
7088;first i love barbecue so;;;;
7089;second i love any place that serves you a pile of meat on a tray;;;;
7090;i am a simple creature;;;;
7091;naked bbq was fun fast and tasty;;;;
7092;the staff was ridiculously nice and fun;;;;
7093;as for the food the sides are bit lackluster and need a bit more of a spicy punch or additional creamy fatty goodness;;;;
7094;but that is totally okay as the meat is the real star here;;;;
7095;we tried four options and we agreed that we both liked the brisket the most;;;;
7096;pulled pork and chicken were tasty as well;;;;
7097;overall it was a fun casual lunch with the before mentioned meat on a tray;;;;
7098;i would totally stop by here for lunch or a brisket pick-up adventure again;;;;
7099;this was my first time here;;;;
7100;i tried the salmon enchiladas with brown rice and cajun beans;;;;
7101;salmon is a tricky fish as i have mentioned in previous reviews;;;;
7102;i was happy to taste well cooked and tender salmon;;;;
7103;the red enchilada sauce was spicy but not unbearable;;;;
7104;the cajun beans were also spicy but tender;;;;
7105;they were made with white beans;;;;
7106;these beans had the right kind of tenderness to indicate they were not canned beans;;;;
7107;the brown rice was regular wheat rice;;;;
7108;this is a great place for some baja fish;;;;
7109;i have visited this location three times;;;;
7110;the staff is nice but they get the order wrong every time and sometimes they are out of things that should be standard for an ice cream shop (out of hot fudge? at 6pm?);;;;
7111;"i know ""first world problems""";;;;
7112;) i can understand one visit being disappointed but three in a row? we probably won't be back;;;;
7113;we'll give the local ice cream place across the street (carolina creamery) a try;;;;
7114;came here on a wednesday afternoon and jessica and kailey were amazing! drinks were ice cold and perfect!!! the staff is so nice and are so fun!!!! love this place!;;;;
7115;palermo's was a pretty decent pizza for the price;;;;
7116;i got the chicken fingers and pizza special for $12 which was a great deal;;;;
7117;the delivery was a bit slow but free so no complaints there;;;;
7118;i'd order again;;;;
7119;for the first i've ever noticed i think i was just cheated on gasoline!;;;;
7120;i was near empty and just got a fill up here where 20;;;;
7121;5 gallons were poured;;;;
7122;generally near empty the max i've ever seen is 18 - 18;;;;
7123;2 because there's reserves;;;;
7124;i just looked it up and i have a 20 gallon tank in my vehicle after reserves are taken into account;;;;
7125;there's definitely something off here;;;;
7126;the machines need to be calibrated properly;;;;
7127;otherwise it seems fine;;;;
7128;kind of dingy for a terrible's location;;;;
7129;i also wouldn't use their car wash;;;;
7130;"it's the ""touchy"" kind that gives your car a million little scrapes ruining the paint job especially apparent if you have a dark car";;;;
7131;if they fix their thieving ways i'd give 'em 3 to 3;;;;
7132;5 stars;;;;
7133;for more they'd need a serious cleaning and update;;;;
7134;when;;;;
7135;she told me that the oven is 2,000 degrees so it only takes the pizza 90 seconds to cook and my order would be ready in 5 minutes i should have hung up the phone! by the time i got it home it was rubbery;;;;
7136;(is that a word?) anyway yuck! we won't be back;;;;
7137;so this is actually not my first time here;;;;
7138;came here a few times already and food is pretty good;;;;
7139;no complaints at all;;;;
7140;you come here for the curries and their rotis;;;;
7141;we ordered the beef brisket curry a fried rice and 2 extra orders of roti;;;;
7142;i wish there was just a bit more beef in the curry;;;;
7143;other than that things were pretty good;;;;
7144;a little on the expensive side;;;;
7145;the portions were a bit small for the prices they are charging;;;;
7146;i guess they can get away with it their food is pretty good after all;;;;
7147;will i come back;;;;
7148;yes;;;;
7149;but will not go out of way to come here;;;;
7150;i don't usually have cravings for curry (never did);;;;
7151;i am always finding things on the small side lately;;;;
7152;no idea why!;;;;
7153;no different to other reviews;;;;
7154;tried the fish tacos and churro definitely a superior mexican/ taco joint around in the city;;;;
7155;omg ! it was not good at all i usually don't give horrible reviews but my father got sick from the vermicelli seafood soup! the seafood was not fresh and was going bad !!!! my pho the soup base was alright but the meat was getting stenchy and you k ow it was getting rotten !!;;;;
7156;came here after a concert at mgm;;;;
7157;service was excellent food was great and we got to sit near the band members we had just seen and got a couple of autographs;;;;
7158;how cool was that;;;;
7159;i took my daughter to see dr lederman in the glendale office as she was needing a shoulder replacement;;;;
7160;i was told he is the best;;;;
7161;my daughter has multiple disabilities from a tbi;;;;
7162;she only has the use of that one arm/shoulder;;;;
7163;of course the doctor knew her condition at the first appointment;;;;
7164;he said she was too young for a replacement as they only last so long and wanted to put off the surgery;;;;
7165;he suggested a series of  shots in the shoulder which did not relieve the pain;;;;
7166;then the next appointment with dr lederman a couple years later due to increasing pain my daughter was sent to a pain clinic again saying she was too young for the surgery and rehab would be hard;;;;
7167;shots in the shoulder and neck did not relieve the pain;;;;
7168;then she was prescribed with pain meds;;;;
7169;this went on another few years;;;;
7170;she was crying in pain everyday and in the night too;;;;
7171;i massaged her up to ten times a day and bought every pain topical solution i could find besides taking the pain meds;;;;
7172;"she cried and  ""begged"" me to cut off her arm several times";;;;
7173;we finally went back to lederman again;;;;
7174;this time my daughter refused to take no for an answer;;;;
7175;she wanted the surgery;;;;
7176;"dr lederman left the room and came back in saying ""i'm not the man for job";;;;
7177;myself or my staff is not accustomed to working with someone with a tbi;;;;
7178;""" then he walked out";;;;
7179;like he did not already know her condition from day one;;;;
7180;my daughter suffered terribly for these years of delaying the surgery then refusing to do it;;;;
7181;he did refer us to another doctor who turned out to be a blessing with a very caring heart;;;;
7182;dr dana seltzer;;;;
7183;the surgery was difficult and the rehab was difficult but we got through it as a team and she is now pain free with most of her shoulder movement intact;;;;
7184;denny's food at beverly hills prices;;;;
7185;one star is for the decor not the food;;;;
7186;worst eggs benedict i have had in my entire life;;;;
7187;bacon is dry;;;;
7188;hollandaise sauce is tasteless and bland;;;;
7189;same for my other half;;;;
7190;belgian waffle saggy;;;;
7191;whipped cream from 99 cent store;;;;
7192;maple syrup is liquid sugar with water;;;;
7193;very  dissaiponting breakfast !!!;;;;
7194;we order out at work every week and got their menu in the mail and gave them a try last week;;;;
7195;pizza hoagies salads and pasta dishes were ordered with no evidence leftover shortly after delivery;;;;
7196;i had pepperoni pizza and it was delicious;;;;
7197;thinner crust than other places and light on the sauce how i prefer my pizza;;;;
7198;coworkers who had other food items enjoyed their lunch too;;;;
7199;looking forward to trying other menu items!;;;;
7200;my regular cleanings are smooth and i've always appreciated the timeliness of each appointment;;;;
7201;any work performed on my teeth have been pain free and effortless which very much appreciated;;;;
7202;overall great atmosphere !!! friendly staff across the board relaxing background music and top notch dental care that delivered an enjoyable experience;;;;
7203;i specifically go to this location even though it's a bit far from me because of the friendly staff and great recommendations!;;;;
7204;sicilian pizza here is amazing as is the alfredo sauce;;;;
7205;food and service are both great;;;;
7206;ordered pizza and cheesy bread for pick up and everything was ready when i got there no extra wait;;;;
7207;will definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu;;;;
7208;i have had a craving for quiznos for quite sometime;;;;
7209;decided to stop in here and try this store out;;;;
7210;quiznos once again satisfied my lunch cravings! the worker was super polite and made my sandwich with all my customizations on point;;;;
7211;thank you quiznos! keep up the good work and please open up more locations!;;;;
7212;not great;;;;
7213;food was stodgy and fairly tasteless and some dishes were cold;;;;
7214;can't really ask for too much out of a lunch buffet but surely tasting of something ought to be the first thing one aims for in food;;;;
7215;save your calories for something else;;;;
7216;hands down worst gluten free cupcake i've ever had;;;;
7217;i cannot believe anyone would associate that product with their name it was terrible;;;;
7218;not only are all the other bakery's gluten free cupcakes superior to this one but so are the grocery store box mixes like the gluten free betty crocker or pilsburry;;;;
7219;this was the first time i've ever thrown away dessert half-way through i always finish or save it for later;;;;
7220;the vanilla flavor wasn't the problem;;;;
7221;it was so dry that i had to take a sip of water with each bite because it would get stuck in my throat;;;;
7222;if you're at fashion square and craving a gluten free treat do yourself a favor and go to the macaroon place;;;;
7223;i'm disappointed especially considering the cupcake was $5 after tax;;;;
7224;the one star is for gluten free cupcakes only as i have not (and cannot) try a regular one;;;;
7225;sexy swanky art deco/craftsman interiors with nightly piano;;;;
7226;serene patio seating for fireside canoodling sunset viewing or enjoying the early desert spring weather;;;;
7227;service was attentive quick and friendly;;;;
7228;the sunset margarita was a fruity and refreshing retreat and went perfectly with my awesome chicken quesadilla;;;;
7229;if i wasn't at the biltmore for work you would've found me here or at the pool my entire stay in phoenix;;;;
7230;frankly disappointed;;;;
7231;guy is one of my favorite chefs i know he's so cool and i love his since of humor;;;;
7232;but his menu is lacking to me;;;;
7233;its so concentrated which can be good;;;;
7234;if the quality can hold up to it;;;;
7235;i got the bacon cheese burger and i could have gotten the same thing at half the price 3 blocks down the strip;;;;
7236;seasonings were bland and lots of grease;;;;
7237;the reason your getting 3 starts guy is because i'm more the sure this restaurant doesn't represent you very well;;;;
7238;i went in to have car detailed and they told me it would take an hour as i was walking away the attendant said oh maybe an hour and a half;;;;
7239;so after an hour and 15 minutes i asked for a status update and they told me another hour!  they have you held captive because they are only part done with each piece;;;;
7240;i quit going to them for oil changes for this very reason;;;;
7241;unable to deliver as promised;;;;
7242;won't be going back for anything except my floor mats which they didn't get put back;;;;
7243;perfect treat this summer;;;;
7244;great service as well;;;;
7245;loved the passion fruit sorbet;;;;
7246;also the mango mojito was a hit;;;;
7247;had them last night;;;;
7248;great morning left overs;;;;
7249;the staff is polite and courteous;;;;
7250;i love their beef mongolian;;;;
7251;i feel like they bread their chicken too much it is mushy;;;;
7252;but great place fast good and clean!;;;;
7253;as my first ever barbershop experience i don't think it can get better than this;;;;
7254;he took his time with my hair to bring it to orgasmic perfection as he explained;;;;
7255;amazing pizza!!! although they did forget my cheese sticks i forgive them but don't let it happen again;;;;
7256;came here with a group of 20+ to see morgan page on 11/30/12;;;;
7257;arrival;;;;
7258;got to the club around 11pm;;;;
7259;getting to the club was simple took only around 15 minutes from the car to the lines (and that included a bit of pre-gaming)!;;;;
7260;entry;;;;
7261;got my entire group on a guestlist with a 1;;;;
7262;1 (guy/girl) comp until midnight;;;;
7263;sign up on their website and you will get a text back if you have been put on;;;;
7264;the entry line was confusing as hell with at least 4 different lines (staff promoter general vip);;;;
7265;there was an open bar for ladies from 11-12 so things were a bit rushed;;;;
7266;this came back to bite me in the ass as i made the mistake of leaving my guestlist line for the shorter staff entry line;;;;
7267;members of my group were with this female staff member who said could get us all free in even though our guy;;;;
7268;girl ratio had more guys;;;;
7269;i spoke with her personally to make sure of it before i left my line;;;;
7270;well;;;;
7271;she lied! the bouncers upfront simply took the first equal ratio of guys;;;;
7272;girls leaving me and another guy stuck paying $40 entry;;;;
7273;my girlfriend was not pleased with the fact that one of my other group members (who came stag) got in for free and i didn't;;;;
7274;whatever lesson learned;;;;
7275;don't rush in;;;;
7276;don't be tempted by an open bar or a shorter line;;;;
7277;stick with guestlist if you're approved;;;;
7278;make sure your group ratio is even or favors girls;;;;
7279;don't listen to otherwise!;;;;
7280;club layout;;;;
7281;the club itself is very nice;;;;
7282;not quite as grand or spacious as xs next door but a beautiful venue nonetheless;;;;
7283;main dance floor is average sized;;;;
7284;it was spacious enough so that we didn't feel like canned sardines and had adequate room to dance;;;;
7285;there are no stairs or steps to climb a la marquee so ladies will appreciate this;;;;
7286;the main room is flanked by a large tent-like area and the outdoor wading pool/patio area;;;;
7287;the easiest accessible restrooms are outside as well (the indoor one gets crowded);;;;
7288;the outdoor area is ideal for those who want to socialize more take pictures take a breather etc;;;;
7289;it's beautiful;;;;
7290;bar;;;;
7291;the indoor bar layout is terrible;;;;
7292;there was maybe 10 feet between the bar and the backs of the booths for those who got tables;;;;
7293;this 10 feet also serves as the main walkway to get to the tent and outdoor area;;;;
7294;not so surprisingly there is a lot of pushing bouncers shining lights and telling you to move and it worst of all;;;;
7295;it takes forever to get a drink! i said before to not by tempted by an open bar for ladies and here's why;;;;
7296;this is the only bar ladies can get free drinks from! on top of that ladies can only get one drink at a time! so ladies if you planned to be here for an hour and get drunk or pass drinks to the guys you'll be disappointed;;;;
7297;the outdoor bar nudged in between the tent/outdoor area is empty and stress-free compared to the one inside so i would recommend buying drinks from here;;;;
7298;drinks were typical vegas prices so expect in the neighborhood of $15 per;;;;
7299;overall i had a great experience at surrender;;;;
7300;the club was beautiful my group had a blast and morgan page (and his opener) rocked it! learn from my mistake stay away from the indoor bar and come with great people and you will have one memorable night! 4/5;;;;
7301;this is a grand place in many ways;;;;
7302;the lobby is pretty the dã©cor is over-the-top disneyland the shops are great the choice of restaurants (which skew towards heavy foods) is good and the rooms are big and comfortable;;;;
7303;the room is probably the best reason to book here if you can get a room during the week for $175 or less;;;;
7304;the room always smelled a bit funky when we first walked in though;;;;
7305;not sure;;;;
7306;maybe time to rip up the carpet;;;;
7307;but this property is crowded;;;;
7308;and the crowds aren't exactly the fun type of las vegas people;;;;
7309;"its like the show ""jersey shore"" invaded the place";;;;
7310;and while i am sure the average person from the garden state is enjoyable this crowd is just too;;;;
7311;too;;;;
7312;cheap and plastic;;;;
7313;gaming there is average strip gaming with a lot of slots and fun machines;;;;
7314;just okay;;;;
7315;was expecting more based on a friends  referral but the food was average and the service was slow and left me disappointed;;;;
7316;$38 for a steak so i expected much more;;;;
7317;the brussel sprouts small plate was on point but overall would not return to this spot;;;;
7318;super quick service from car to terminal and vice versa;;;;
7319;the cheap rates are also great and you can always find coupons online;;;;
7320;very fast to go service;;;;
7321;the pad thai is made from bigger noodles than i'm used to but had a very good flavor;;;;
7322;this place is awesome!! the atmosphere is very cozy and if you are a veteran you whole meal is free! i've been in the military for almost 4 years and have never been to a place that has offered something like that to veterans;;;;
7323;it was a pleasant surprise;;;;
7324;the staff is very nice and the food is great!! definitely worth the stop!!;;;;
7325;first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family owned;;;;
7326;real ecuadorian helado de paila or gelato!! beautifully fresh and flavorful gelato!;;;;
7327;also wonderful service to boot!! my favorite is key lime and twighlight flavored! the owners are amazingly sweet people come support this business!! you wont be disappointed!;;;;
7328;great quality of food!! the plates looked very clean and appetizing;;;;
7329;the fish were fresh and was well proportioned with the rice - which i'm kind of particular about;;;;
7330;very nice service as well;;;;
7331;parking is a bit tight and there is also limited seating especially during peak dinner hours;;;;
7332;definitely would like to try take-out next time;;;;
7333;perfect place to relax after our red rock adventures!!  great drinks and great food;;;;
7334;definitely try the philly fries;;;;
7335;sit in sarah's section!  first time having her serve us;;;;
7336;very friendly and attentive!!  thanks!!;;;;
7337;it use to be that when i have my annual vacation to vegas with either my girlfriends or husband koi was the place to go to get my sushi needs;;;;
7338;ever since i went to social house i certainly changed my mind about going to koi again!;;;;
7339;my girl friend and i went to social house last saturday a little before 5 before the restaurant opened for dinner;;;;
7340;the host was very friendly and informed us that the restaurant was not opened for dinner yet;;;;
7341;my girl friend and i each had a a cocktail while we waited;;;;
7342;"wow! i loved their ""socialite"" cocktail and my girlfriend was amazed by their ""lycheetini""";;;;
7343;both drinks were incredible!! this definitely gave us a boost of confidence about the meal we were about to have;;;;
7344;"when it was time for dinner we picked a bottle of sparkling sake called ""hana awaka""";;;;
7345;it was sincerely the best sparkling sake we've ever had;;;;
7346;it was a little pricey (then again what's not pricey in vegas?) but it was definitely an amazing experience to try something new!;;;;
7347;the food oh the food was just so incredible;;;;
7348;my favorites were hamachi jalapeno hamachi tartar miso cod lettuce cups and uni;;;;
7349;all of the dishes have nice portion since it's meant to be shared which i thought was a great concept!  the food was just so fresh and nicely flavored we actually ordered some dishes again!  my girl friend and i were definitely in sushi heaven;;;;
7350;everyone in the restaurant were extremely friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there;;;;
7351;the manager came to ask us twice to see if we were satisfied with the food and if we were having a good time;;;;
7352;my water never went below half empty as the water and busboy constantly refills it as soon as i drank some;;;;
7353;for someone who drinks a lot of water with my meal and so i'm constantly asking for more water this is a huge plus for me;;;;
7354;the ambiance was amazing;;;;
7355;we enjoyed the trendy music but it was not too loud we couldn't hear our own conversation;;;;
7356;overall we had an incredible experience dining at social house;;;;
7357;it was such a fantastic meal my girl friend and i were still talking about it half an house after we walked out of the restaurant!  this is definitely one place we have to visit every time we go to vegas!;;;;
7358;of course the food is good employees are nice but i have never been to a slower chick-fil-a in my life;;;;
7359;i sat through the drive thru for 20 mins;;;;
7360;chick-fil-a is always super fast but these people seemed to have zero urgency;;;;
7361;extremely annoying;;;;
7362;wow!!! what a place;;;;
7363;took the kids here after easter brunch and had a great time;;;;
7364;can get a little pricey if not careful;;;;
7365;it took me an extra order of doughnut holes to convince them to leave!;;;;
7366;i want to start by saying that the staff there are all very friendly and knowledgeable however i have not had a good experience there;;;;
7367;i have a chronic eye condition that requires me to get a hard contact lens for one eye;;;;
7368;typically i had to go to oakland to get all this done and i wanted to see if i could find somewhere closer to home;;;;
7369;i got new glasses lenses and a new hard lens here;;;;
7370;first they lost the order for my eyeglasses;;;;
7371;they never realized this until about a month after my visit and i called having not heard anything;;;;
7372;when i got them the prescription was far too strong and they had to back it off;;;;
7373;so getting my glasses took over two months;;;;
7374;for my hard lens it took time to get that correct as well but that is expected;;;;
7375;it also took me several times asking my oakland optometrist to get my records faxed to them;;;;
7376;mccauley-celin at first said they never received them but they then found them in another computer system;;;;
7377;when the first lens didn't fit quite right i went to the wexford office to get it checked and left my lens there as it needed to be returned;;;;
7378;when my new lens came they asked for my old one and apparently it was lost out there or somewhere;;;;
7379;i paid for my lens with my fsa account but then was told that it should be covered under my insurance and that they would take care of it;;;;
7380;that didn't happen so i called to ask about it;;;;
7381;they never got back to me so i went to their gibsonia office and they said that they owed me money and it was fixed;;;;
7382;this all again took several months;;;;
7383;if you just need glasses and lenses and are fairly routine in your needs you'll probably be fine;;;;
7384;but i'm going back to oakland i guess;;;;
7385;the office staff just can't handle anything;;;;
7386;beautiful facilities and excellent massage;;;;
7387;going back tomorrow and hopefully every time i visit toronto from now on!;;;;
7388;travel weary and need of food - as i walked out my hotel heard some excellent acoustic music - enjoying some music   turns out it was $5 burger night - bonus -  california burger was juicy and the gauc and grilled onion perfect - i also tried the tortilla soup which i enjoyed;;;;
7389;i also enjoyed the skinny crunchy fries and the chilled and crisp pickle the service was fast and friendly;;;;
7390;when i back to phx and near the convention center i'll come again;;;;
7391;i'm a sucker for a good falafel  and this place delivers;;;;
7392;ordered the combo with a side of hummus;;;;
7393;tasty  fresh falafel and good but a little loose hummus;;;;
7394;would definitely come here again;;;;
7395;i used red carpet vip to set up my friend's bachelor party;;;;
7396;the customer service was awesome and all of my phone calls were either answered immediately or i got a call back within the hour;;;;
7397;everything went exactly how they said it would;;;;
7398;we scheduled for 3 separate limo pick ups and all 3 were on time and the drivers were awesome and courteous;;;;
7399;we also got a hosted entry to xs for that night with calvin harris dj-ing so it was a crazy line;;;;
7400;getting in was really easy the host texted me earlier in the evening so i could tell him when we would be getting to xs and then arranged to meet us outside the club and walked us right in past the giant line (even past the endless line for all girl groups) of people waiting hours to see calvin harris;;;;
7401;honestly i can not say enough about how painless the whole process was and how awesome all of the staff were throughout the whole process;;;;
7402;these guys are now my go to if i need to get in to a crowded event or club in vegas;;;;
7403;we are so sad to see sabrina leave orange county!!!  we have depended on her for the past 4 years petsitting our huge english mastiff;;;;
7404;sabrina has made our lives so much easier to travel with peace of mind knowing that kali would be well taken care of and even giving up updates and pictures while we were gone;;;;
7405;do not hesitate to use sabrina - she is really as fabulous as everyone on this site says;;;;
7406;no kidding!!!  and if she ever comes back to o;;;;
7407;we will welcome her back with open paws!!!;;;;
7408;been here a few times the service is super slow just to order a coffee;;;;
7409;coffee prices are not cheap;;;;
7410;ive had the sandwiches which are pretty good but heavy;;;;
7411;most people come here to use the free wifi and they sit for hours drinking water;;;;
7412;not my favourite place and the inside could be fixed up a little more;;;;
7413;as a mexican born and raised in california i'm sorry this place was horrible!! the chili had a strange taste !! we just threw it away! and bought hamburgers from b k and that says a lot!! don't waste your time!!!;;;;
7414;it could have been an off day for them!!;;;;
7415;anyways as we ordered through the drive thru i was practically yelling thinking omgosh really!!;;;;
7416;never again!!;;;;
7417;if you try it let me know if you like it ok lol;;;;
7418;loved the one out rea rd and now thrilled they are open near my house;;;;
7419;good korean grill near eaton centre;;;;
7420;the marinate is good;;;;
7421;we got beef ox liver salmon fish fillet chicken pork pork belly;;;;
7422;the fish fillet was bland and liver was meh;;;;
7423;salmon and chicken was really flavourable;;;;
7424;such a fun place to eat at for a date or group of friends;;;;
7425;even alone;;;;
7426;no judgments here;;;;
7427;the staff is attentive nice and considerate;;;;
7428;bigger groups will most likely be seated on the second floor which is way bigger;;;;
7429;caution;;;;
7430;will smell like bbq grill after;;;;
7431;not a fan;;;;
7432;overpriced over cooked bland burgers;;;;
7433;everything is extra (fries onion rings);;;;
7434;i cam here for a late dinner/ drinks for a work social;;;;
7435;the staff was very pleasant and the atmosphere was great;;;;
7436;tv's surrounding the walls which is always a plus in my books;;;;
7437;we started with drinks most were to shy to try the spiked milkshakes and stick to beer;;;;
7438;but one brave sole tried the chocolate monkey milkshake it looked delicious!;;;;
7439;the food was great they sure do know how to make a burger the kobe beef burger was my choice and it was fantastic! a huge selection of toppings to add;;;;
7440;the one downfall to this place is the bathrooms are in the basement and are by no means roomy;;;;
7441;in fact i smacked my head off the roof as i tried to squeeze my way into the stalls;;;;
7442;cool place worth a try if you are in the area;;;;
7443;chilis is a bar and grill restaurant;;;;
7444;it offers a dining area for you to sit in and at a table;;;;
7445;it also gives you a bar so you can just sit at and enjoy drinks that have been made by the bartender;;;;
7446;it offers a variety of food;;;;
7447;from entrees like burgers steak and fish and if you are not feeling to hungry then they have appetizers like hot wings sliders chips and salsa and so many more options;;;;
7448;also they allow you to order your food from home and pick it up and take it home;;;;
7449;i personally like that there is so many options to choose from on the menu;;;;
7450;i like how they also cater to the needs of someone trying to be healthy and watch their diet by adding healthy items to the menu;;;;
7451;the staff is great and helpful;;;;
7452;they don't hang around and watch you eat;;;;
7453;they check in at appropriate times to refill your drinks and ask how you're doing;;;;
7454;the only thing i dislike is the waiting time;;;;
7455;i usually have to wait 30 minutes to be seated;;;;
7456;but that is because i usually go on the weekends so it is understandable;;;;
7457;i would give this restaurant 4 out of 5 stars;;;;
7458;did a bogo for samsung galaxy s9 in april 2018;;;;
7459;arranged for in-store pick up;;;;
7460;got the phone paid off my old one and closed a tablet line;;;;
7461;all was good and my bill should of went down $10!;;;;
7462;two months later my bill went up $60;;;;
7463;called verizon said it was stores mess up;;;;
7464;called store they put me back on the call center;;;;
7465;got the call center to submit a form 3x to fix the promotion and was denied for various reasons the final one being the account was past due because they charge me extra per month;;;;
7466;i have paid it all off again and filed a bbb complaint;;;;
7467;i don't care if the call center or the store fixes it it just needs to be done right;;;;
7468;i have been a customer for over 10 years this is not a way to treat a long standing client;;;;
7469;comfortable surroundings;;;;
7470;great service;;;;
7471;food was very good;;;;
7472;defiantly will be back to try the rest of the menu and for dinner as well;;;;
7473;our regular plumber is great but a little pricey so we decided to try someone new;;;;
7474;belsito's rating on yelp made us give them a try;;;;
7475;we called on a saturday afternoon for a non-emergency;;;;
7476;they told us someone would call us back and let us know when they could come out;;;;
7477;about an hour later the doorbell rang and it was the plumber;;;;
7478;luckily we were home as we never got a call;;;;
7479;the plumber was friendly and got right to work;;;;
7480;he was able to take care of one problem but needed a part for the second one;;;;
7481;it turned out that he could not order the part (??) and we had to do it ourselves;;;;
7482;once the part arrived about a week and a half later the plumber came back out to finish the work;;;;
7483;he did a decent job and was a nice guy;;;;
7484;but they were extremely expensive;;;;
7485;we certainly did not save any money going with belsito;;;;
7486;also when he was out the first time the plumber left some dirt on our carpeted steps;;;;
7487;he was wearing booties so not sure how he got the dirt there;;;;
7488;it was easy to clean up so not a huge problem;;;;
7489;now that is off season for summer take advantage of the 49;;;;
7490;00 tune up;;;;
7491;just had mine done today;;;;
7492;we also just purchased a condo for my mom and the inspector from our realtor's referral  was not allowed on the roof as an inspector to check the unit so we hired dukes of air and it needed a $300 repair that the seller will have to fix;;;;
7493;best place to get a tattoo hands down;;;;
7494;the shop is very clean;;;;
7495;the guys that work there are very good at what they do and take a lot of pride in their work;;;;
7496;i live in texas now and still fly to phx twice a year to have fat rat tattoo me;;;;
7497;you won't be disappointed in your work if you go here!!! promise!!;;;;
7498;i liked it and it was 33 degrees outside;;;;
7499;i usually don't eat ice cream with gloves on;;;;
7500;three scoops for a regular was more than enough for the two of us;;;;
7501;valhrona chocolate was really good;;;;
7502;pumpkin pie was so so;;;;
7503;local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city;;;;
7504;my bf and i go all the time for brunch and they also have really good burgers too;;;;
7505;my favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio;;;;
7506;they usually bring the dogs little dog bowls with water and sometimes even a cookie!  try the coca cola ham omelet for brunch;;;;
7507;ah-mazing!;;;;
7508;i opened up a business and needed photos taken for my website;;;;
7509;"i told her my vision gave her a couple sample images of what ""look"" we were going for and i just sat back and watched her as she just took off with our concept and did something incredible with it";;;;
7510;michelle is an incredibly talented person;;;;
7511;she picked the best locations and went above and beyond to ensure that our photos and website turned out great! i would recommend her in a heartbeat and she is who i will continue to go to for all our business' photography needs;;;;
7512;thanks michelle!;;;;
7513;7/15/17;;;;
7514;came to vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and saturday just seemed to want us to be at encore beach club the entire day/night;;;;
7515;first we attended diplo with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list;;;;
7516;came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy;;;;
7517;we ate there while letting the sunscreen dry then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing;;;;
7518;the staff was great the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness just people from all over having the time of our lives;;;;
7519;the rave-booty was twerk-tacular;;;;
7520;there were spankings;;;;
7521;the bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking;;;;
7522;all i saw were smiles;;;;
7523;you could see diplo from any of the pools except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the dj;;;;
7524;we danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people;;;;
7525;as more of my group came in from all over we came back for marshmello saturday night (nightswim!) whom i hadn't seen since edc last year;;;;
7526;we got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing we'd want a dry drinking spot haha;;;;
7527;our view was fantastic table was perfect the vip even invited us into the small vip pool behind us;;;;
7528;we got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose which did great for our group;;;;
7529;i was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as i forgot to tell the bank i was leaving the state;;;;
7530;my host alexia beholder of a supernatural beauty waited patiently and kindly while i called the card and had them over-ride the security hold;;;;
7531;"she was calm and pleasant and simply said ""this happens all the time";;;;
7532;""" (this was in stark contrast to the treatment at omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined)";;;;
7533;alexia and her runner damn i totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy) treated us incredibly well;;;;
7534;she came back and poured drinks throughout the night not just the obligatory first round;;;;
7535;they also made sure we stayed hydrated! super important when it's 100 at night;;;;
7536;they gave us just the right amount of attention and class;;;;
7537;thank you guys and special thanks to alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door;;;;
7538;saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! truly i don't expect anything less from encore/wynn (xs surrender/encore beach club) - i never get anything less than the best experience there over the span of years that i have both attended with tickets and tables;;;;
7539;they are the best they will always be the best;;;;
7540;thanks again!;;;;
7541;the gelato here is sent from the gods themselves;;;;
7542;just kidding;;;;
7543;desyree makes everything that goes into the gelato herself;;;;
7544;same difference right?;;;;
7545;i am thrilled i found this place! dr;;;;
7546;brown and his staff are wonderful! dr;;;;
7547;brown spent a lot of time on the examination and answered our many questions;;;;
7548;i appreciated that he didn't push any unnecessary services or products on us;;;;
7549;he found a lump on one of our cats and told us just to monitor it and bring him back in if it gets any worse rather than opting to run a bunch of expensive tests on him immediately;;;;
7550;we brought our cat in about a month later to have the tests done and he was very upfront about the cost and what they were testing for;;;;
7551;i also like that they send you an appointment reminder text the day before;;;;
7552;their prices are reasonable and the first exam is free;;;;
7553;this is the only place i'll be bringing my cats to from now on!;;;;
7554;this is my go-to grocery store when i am too lazy to head to winco;;;;
7555;i have been here well over a hundred times and the experience is pretty standard for smith's stores in my experience;;;;
7556;i have never had a problem with stocking here which is good;;;;
7557;items are always stocked well regardless of when in the week you come;;;;
7558;i am not the biggest fan of their produce however;;;;
7559;about 20% of the time i bring how green beans or asparagus and two days later they are covered in mold (and no it is not my refrigerator);;;;
7560;so i no longer purchase produce here except for when i am in a bind;;;;
7561;store is also always clean i have never once seen a spill or poorly arranged merchandise which is a testament to the hard working staff;;;;
7562;the staff are always very helpful and friendly;;;;
7563;they don't always have enough baggers but last time i was there they had plenty and wouldn't even let me unload my cart (they had a separate person in the aisle that unloaded people's carts for them);;;;
7564;first time i've experienced that and it was pretty great;;;;
7565;prices are a bit on the high side overall i would not shop here if you do not use your smith's card;;;;
7566;the prices are outrageous with out it;;;;
7567;however they end up being pretty reasonable when you remember to use the gas points (which is now made easier by the smith's gas station located directly in front of this store);;;;
7568;they definitely need way more cart corrals in the parking lot;;;;
7569;like at least double the amount they currently have;;;;
7570;there are none closer to the gas station and when the store is busy people are too lazy to walk their carts back to the corrals and i've seen carts fly into parked cars on at least three separate occasions;;;;
7571;i hope smith's management reads this review and fixes this problem soon;;;;
7572;it's been about two weeks since omar did my window tint;;;;
7573;it looks great he had to scrap off old nasty window tint that started to bubble;;;;
7574;the work they do is awesome this is the 3rd vehicle he has done for me;;;;
7575;i've been very happy every time;;;;
7576;i'll for sure always keep my business with him;;;;
7577;prices are fair but the quality and professional service speaks for itself;;;;
7578;thanks omar;;;;
7579;nestled in what is (for now) a relatively sleepy corner of downtown urban bodega (aka urbo) feels like something of a throwback to some of the small convenience stores i used to see line the roosevelt row neighborhood;;;;
7580;back when downtown was still a neighborhood where only the most diehard entrepreneurs dared to tread you could find one of these small neighborhood shops selling everything from wine and beer to snacks to cooking essentials and even a few household cleaning items;;;;
7581;the relatively new pure fillmore apartment complex is currently the first of what will undoubtedly be many new apartment and condo complexes lining 7th avenue in downtown;;;;
7582;but for now the nearest full sized grocery store requires a car;;;;
7583;all the more reason urbo's location makes sense;;;;
7584;you'll find urbo on the bottom floor of the pure fillmore apartments on fillmore street just east of 7th avenue;;;;
7585;the brainchild of desoto central market alum shawn connelly you enter here through the front patio area (where there's seating for eight by the way);;;;
7586;inside its a whole lot of stuff mixed into a small space;;;;
7587;behind the counter you can get coffee tea or even a sandwich made on the spot;;;;
7588;in front of the counter it's essentially a small independent convenience store with many of the things you'd expect;;;;
7589;candy bars meds condiments snacks microwavable items beer wine soda as well as odds and ends like tissue paper shampoo and storage bags;;;;
7590;i can well imagine some downtown college students living in the apartments upstairs too hung over or too tired to drive two miles to safeway and instead opting for a stop here;;;;
7591;for my first stop here on a saturday morning i opted to get a quick morning pick me up;;;;
7592;a tea and a sandwich;;;;
7593;i got their salted caramel iced tea (also available hot) and their turkey sausage egg & cheese sandwich on an english muffin;;;;
7594;both made to order;;;;
7595;total cost including tax;;;;
7596;$10;;;;
7597;now to be fair they prepared the sandwich in part using a microwave so we're not talking gourmet here;;;;
7598;still the sandwich hit the spot and the sausage in particular was very tasty;;;;
7599;i was also very happy with the tea;;;;
7600;almost tasted like a southern style sweet tea of sorts with those caramel accents;;;;
7601;a solid breakfast;;;;
7602;so there you have it;;;;
7603;a locally owned business filling a need in an emerging neighborhood;;;;
7604;nothing pretentious;;;;
7605;just a good straight forward progressive independent convenience store;;;;
7606;even if you don't live in this quiet corner of downtown its worth a look;;;;
7607;or a sip and bite and it was in my case;;;;
7608;fitness together;;;;
7609;i can say nothing but positive things about my experience at fitness together steele creek;;;;
7610;the facility is clean and well equipped and the staff is knowledgeable and full of personality;;;;
7611;when my wife and i first showed up we had a deal to try five sessions for 99 dollars;;;;
7612;we had talked for a while about joining a gym but fitness together is so much more;;;;
7613;it's like a community of people working toward a common goal of getting fit and taking control of their health;;;;
7614;the owner joe is very knowledgeable in fitness exercise and most importantly nutrition;;;;
7615;he worked with us to set up individual  nutrition plans and exercise programs to help us attain our goals;;;;
7616;included with your sessions purchase is a fitness assessment which measures body fat percentage fitness levels resting heart rate flexibility and a few other factors;;;;
7617;additional assessments are given throughout your tenure as a fitness together member so you can watch your total body transformation;;;;
7618;it is a very encouraging atmosphere no matter your current level of fitness;;;;
7619;at first i dreaded going to exercise but after seeing the positive changes you just can't wait to get back;;;;
7620;i like the fact that sessions can be purchased in packages without a long term commitment but i must say i continue to add additional sessions;;;;
7621;this is mainly because i continue to see results;;;;
7622;my wife and i are both stronger healthier and happier thanks to joe and his knowledgeable and helpful staff;;;;
7623;i highly recommend fitness together to anyone looking to get into shape tone up lose some inches or lbs;;;;
7624;it's been a great experience;;;;
7625;went to alchemy today because my friend was craving a burger;;;;
7626;i had never dined here before but she had and suggested it;;;;
7627;i was thoroughly impressed;;;;
7628;she had the bison burger which was to die for i had a bite and instantly wanted another;;;;
7629;i ordered the blft and it was loaded with bacon and flavor;;;;
7630;i had some minor issues with it first being that there was just a little too much aioli on the bread and second that the fried tomato was a red tomato and not a green tomato;;;;
7631;i just found the texture of the tomato unappetizing;;;;
7632;i also enjoyed their bloody mary and they have a nice local craft beer selection;;;;
7633;for dessert we had the espresso torte and it was one of the best i have ever had;;;;
7634;service was also spot on and i will be returning soon to get the bison burger for myself!;;;;
7635;this was a great find near pittsburgh alternative to down town scene;;;;
7636;ambiance was great on the deck by the river and service was excellent (thanks melisa for history lessens!);;;;
7637;seafood including oysters were fresh and well prepared;;;;
7638;"price was reasonable for ""prefix"" menu including scrumptious dessert";;;;
7639;what an evening to end a fantastic summer day in pittsburgh;;;;
7640;looking for a big hearty breakfast? then look no further because this place has got exactly what you're looking for (and for a pretty reasonable price);;;;
7641;i went here with my friend after a night of *ahem* good old madison weekend fun and this was exactly what we needed;;;;
7642;i got the eggs mornay which has this sausage patty and poached eggs with this very nice sauce on top of an english muffin;;;;
7643;and if that wasn't enough carbs for you it comes with a generous helping of fried potatoes;;;;
7644;good stuff;;;;
7645;also a random note;;;;
7646;despite its appearance as an old fashioned diner i got a very hipster-y vibe from it once i got in;;;;
7647;as convenience stores go this one could be the poster child for what is wrong with the concept;;;;
7648;while the need for procurement of gas is a subject for another forum the food options are fair game;;;;
7649;or in this case more like not fair and lame;;;;
7650;amazing;;;;
7651;brooke and michael are very professional and helpful;;;;
7652;they designed the most beautiful custom wedding invites for me;;;;
7653;they incorporated all of the elements that i asked for and made any changes that i asked for promptly;;;;
7654;it was a little on the expensive side for wedding invites but you get what you pay for and i know i couldn't have done it without them;;;;
7655;they produced exactly what i wanted;;;;
7656;very happy! even my vendors asked if they could have one of the invites!;;;;
7657;nothing special here;;;;
7658;it's about what you'd expect out of a mongolian barbecue style chain;;;;
7659;choose your base meat and carbohydrate (but not portions that is set) add your choice of vegetables then watch them roast it in front of you;;;;
7660;i went with chicken and rice noodles and a ginger garlic sauce;;;;
7661;the finished product tasted like propane;;;;
7662;the guys frying everything up work hard but their efforts are about the best thing you can say about this place;;;;
7663;i still like it better than noodlecat though as it doesn't seem to take itself seriously;;;;
7664;many of the kanji on the wall are backwards/upside down;;;;
7665;loved this place!;;;;
7666;the food was very good and the drinks were fantastic but more importantly the service was outstanding;;;;
7667;we all started with cocktails - margaritas and mojitos;;;;
7668;the margarita was made with bourbon and rimed with crushed bacon and salt (yes i said bacon);;;;
7669;the mojitos were fresh and minty;;;;
7670;the one thing i we all really like about the drinks was that they were not too sweet;;;;
7671;we ordered two apps for the table - lobster fritters and braised beef short rib poutine;;;;
7672;omg the poutine was out of this world!!  the fritters were good but there was no lobster flavor;;;;
7673;i think next time i would just order the vegetable fritters;;;;
7674;for mains we had fried fish tacos steak burrito jambalaya and grilled pork chop with red potato salad;;;;
7675;the jambalaya and the pork chop were features;;;;
7676;the burritos was very nice;;;;
7677;the steak was a nice medium rare and it came with guacamole and lime crema;;;;
7678;fish tacos were delish!  the corn tortillas really make a difference;;;;
7679;the pork chop feature was really good;;;;
7680;my friend found it to be a little fatty but for those of us who love pork fat it was perfect;;;;
7681;the only dish that fell short was the jambalya;;;;
7682;the sausage in the dish had great flavor but the overall dish didn't seem to come together;;;;
7683;you would think by now we would be full but we sucked it up and ordered dessert;;;;
7684;two sweet potato pies beignets and a patron creme brulee;;;;
7685;my word it was good;;;;
7686;the sweet potato pie was more of a bread pudding with a bourbon carmel sauce;;;;
7687;the creme brulee was one of the best i've had - it had a lovely fresh citrus flavor;;;;
7688;the beignets were tougher than i expected but still good;;;;
7689;i would like to point something out about this place;;;;
7690;no the food isn't cheap but the quality of the ingredients justifies the cost;;;;
7691;our meal with tax and tip was $200 (for four);;;;
7692;the food was really good but what sets them apart is the service;;;;
7693;the restuarant was fairly busy and there was only one waiter who had the assitance of the owners amy and albert;;;;
7694;yes there were times when we seemed to be waiting awhile for things but they made sure that we never felt forgotton;;;;
7695;they went out of their way to talk to us and make us feel welcome;;;;
7696;i've been to some really nice restaurants and had some incredible food but i've never been made to feel as welcome as did at the combine eatery;;;;
7697;we arrived here at 10;;;;
7698;00am and weren't able to get a full tour until 1;;;;
7699;00pm so we opted for the mini tour;;;;
7700;it was very informative and interesting;;;;
7701;it starts with a brief video about the dam which lasts about 10 minutes;;;;
7702;then you are led to a line where you wait for your tour to begin;;;;
7703;the take you down the elevator into the depths of the dam;;;;
7704;you get to see all the workings and information about how it was built;;;;
7705;the our guides are entertaining as well- as dam entertaining as you can be about a dam tour;;;;
7706;lol;;;;
7707;after the tour concludes you are allowed to walk outside and see the dam from a great viewpoint;;;;
7708;awesome time to take pictures and really enjoy the massive beauty of this place;;;;
7709;there is also a small exhibit inside which tells you more about how hoover dam was built and what it took;;;;
7710;it is so amazing that people built this place so long ago and the horrendous conditions they had to endure;;;;
7711;just standing outside in late july- temperatures topped 106 but in the sun it felt like 120;;;;
7712;once you are done exploring the inside exhibits and views you can wander outside and walk the dam;;;;
7713;beware that when you leave the dam touring area you cannot return it is a one way only exit;;;;
7714;i recommend bringing lots of waters and hats as the heat made exploring the dam outside almost unbearable;;;;
7715;after checking the outside of the dam we walked over to little souvenir shop and bought some items;;;;
7716;by that time we were hot and starved so we stopped at the small deli/snack shop at the dam and snagged a table to eat lunch;;;;
7717;beware it can get very crowded;;;;
7718;we ordered a small deli sandwich and some chicken tenders/fries for the kids;;;;
7719;tip;;;;
7720;bring your own bagged lunch and sit on the shaded areas/benches during your walk of the dam to really enjoy the experience;;;;
7721;there is a subway on your drive in to stop at;;;;
7722;this was a memorable amazing visit and is one of those places you see that you will remember forever;;;;
7723;sucks;;;;
7724;i'm there trying to buy texture for paint and four guys in that department are all busy bullshitting except for the black man that is there to work and help people;;;;
7725;also i bought a toilet a month ago and they said someone would contact me in two days;;;;
7726;a little over two weeks after my son and i ended up installing it they called;;;;
7727;one star because i had too;;;;
7728;i will never rent from budget rent a car again;;;;
7729;i got totally ripped off by their employee at the phoenix airport location on 5/3/18;;;;
7730;he added the fuel surcharge of $40+ to my bill despite specifically being told i didn't want that i would fill the car up with gas myself before returning the car;;;;
7731;he also told me insurance would be $30 not specifying that it would be $30 + taxes for each day i had the car;;;;
7732;"when i asked how my $61 booking (on costco) became a $200+ rental he told me ""arizona has a lot of taxes""";;;;
7733;given that it took so long to wait and then for him to prepare the contract i did not read everything---i had my 87 year old father in a wheelchair with me;;;;
7734;when i complained to budget later i was told sorry you signed the contract;;;;
7735;shady shady business;;;;
7736;the staff is very nice and helpful but there pricing sucks!!!!! very over priced;;;;
7737;i went with my wife and my sister and brother in law we all wanted to get tattoos;;;;
7738;i have 6 so i am fairly familiar with tattoo pricing;;;;
7739;long story short why wife wanted a small piece that should be around $75 to vegas price maybe $150;;;;
7740;they wanted $350 bucks! they must be joking right my piece that should be maybe $150-200 they wanted $750;;;;
7741;the point is that they apparently think that the ink is liquid gold or something;;;;
7742;truly enjoyed working with fred lembo! we just closed on our first home and couldn't be happier with fred and his team;;;;
7743;no matter what happened in the process he did not let us down;;;;
7744;he always had our backs made sure that we understood all routes and options and made the process fun and exciting;;;;
7745;unlike other agents that we had worked with fred never made us feel like he was reluctant to show us properties;;;;
7746;"he was very patient with us throughout the process and gave us time and space to make decisions all while going above and beyond in the ""background"" to be prepared for all scenarios so that we were always ""ready to go"" when needed";;;;
7747;fred is also an excellent negotiator and helped us feel confident and comfortable with what could have otherwise been some very overwhelming circumstances;;;;
7748;we would highly recommend fred to anyone purchasing or selling a home;;;;
7749;it was a privilege to work with him shannan and the rest of the north&co team!;;;;
7750;the atmosphere may be what you'd expect of a bar in the middle of a suburban development but the food and drink are pretty good;;;;
7751;our friends love their beer we gushed over their root beer;;;;
7752;the malted berry drink was perfect for lightweights;;;;
7753;the wisco porker pizza was tasty and full of meat - just as you would want and expect;;;;
7754;nice bonus - free shots after touchdowns during badger games;;;;
7755;woop!;;;;
7756;atmosphere is nice decor is cute and staff is really nice;;;;
7757;the most important thing is that the food is bomb;;;;
7758;i got a buche taco al pastor taco and mexican corn on the cob;;;;
7759;the al pastor taco was the best out of all of them with lots of juicy meat despite it looking weird and dry on the meat spinner (is that what it's called?);;;;
7760;buche taco didn't have as much meat which was kinda sad;;;;
7761;the corn was delicious however the amount of parmesan cheese on top killed it a bit;;;;
7762;the mole fries are amazing;;;;
7763;ten out of ten will come back for them;;;;
7764;we love this pastries shop during our stayed in montreal;;;;
7765;i tried a few other bakeries near the area i don't believe in going back to the same place twice when exploring a new town;;;;
7766;however this place is so good;;;;
7767;they have the most amazing chocolate croissant almond croissant blueberry tart and not to mention their specialty kouign amann;;;;
7768;the only thing that we didn't like was the apple turnover( a little tart for our taste) and the cafe au lait(a little on the light side);;;;
7769;loco patrãµn is my favorite mexican restaurant in the valley;;;;
7770;when i first tried loco patrãµn i wasn't expecting it to be great i figured it would be typical bar food;;;;
7771;but i was blown away by how delicious the food was! the presentation is fabulous and the service is always prompt;;;;
7772;it is a great place to take your friends or family;;;;
7773;i highly recommend it!;;;;
7774;as an ex-nyer i have a pretty high standard of bagel;;;;
7775;these did not disappoint but i wouldn't say they are truly singular in their yumminess;;;;
7776;my review is based solely on these as we did not try the desserts or anything else;;;;
7777;"some of the bagels seemed ""fresher"" than others and if you've ever had a nyc bagel before 8am you know the expectations i have";;;;
7778;i also feel like the bagels were kinda skinny and the holes were big;;;;
7779;i'm used to really fat chewy but pillowy ones;;;;
7780;sigh;;;;
7781;but it really pains me to give anything lower than 4 stars as they have a lot of traditional jewish/nyc deli delicacies which you really don't see out here in lv;;;;
7782;if that is your thing you really should check it out! the rye bread with caraway seeds looked good;;;;
7783;the dessert section also piqued my interest;;;;
7784;please don't get a black & white cookie - hell will freeze over before anyone ever likes those trust me;;;;
7785;the shop is located in the weirdest shopping complex - it feels like a dr's office belongs here;;;;
7786;inside it was pretty poppin' (it was sunday) but the line wasn't bad;;;;
7787;all in all i will be back again to try more;;;;
7788;i'm the first to give any starbucks 5 stars because i am usually a fan;;;;
7789;with that said i am not a huge fan of this location;;;;
7790;first of all i am not sure if this is country wide but they charge 70c cad to add a few drops of soymilk to some cold brew iced coffee which is free in the us;;;;
7791;additionally their cold brew did not have the smooth flavor of the cold brew i am used to at starbucks;;;;
7792;third mobile ordering doesn't appear to be functioning for this store or in canada (this may be an app limitation and not specific to this location);;;;
7793;on a good note the bagel was edible and they had some type of guacamole avocado spread in a container which was better than i was expecting;;;;
7794;update;;;;
7795;i did write to corporate on the fact that i was charged money to put a few drops of soy milk in my cold brew and they did confirm that this is not a correct practice to charge for tiny amount of soy milk in iced coffee;;;;
7796;if you're looking for a sweet and fabulous cocktail dress or lovely special item for a date petal is a solid choice;;;;
7797;when petal first opened i was taken aback by the open airy space but also by the prices;;;;
7798;at first blush this store didn't offer much under $150-$200 besides accessories;;;;
7799;yet over time petal has begun to bring in a more varied selection that appeals to a wider stylish market;;;;
7800;while they still offer the $300-$450 cocktail dresses they also showcase a variety of merchandise in the $75-$100 range;;;;
7801;plus if you can catch them on a sale day it's worth a trip;;;;
7802;brand wise you'll find upscale brands like shoshanna amanda uprichard alice & trixie frock by tracy reese james jeans anlo and citizens for humanity;;;;
7803;as mentioned they have begun to add more affordable pieces from greylin and la clothing;;;;
7804;you'll also spy a handful of accessories and handbags scattered about in a range of prices;;;;
7805;overall i like petal and i know i'll saunter back in even if just to take in the lovely dresses and stunning tops they have on display;;;;
7806;here's hoping they continue to add in more variety with price points!;;;;
7807;we only sampled a few small plates but they were good;;;;
7808;the staff was helpful but their beer selection is lacking;;;;
7809;we sat on the patio and it was okay but they need to invest in some plants for their planters;;;;
7810;just having the old dead plants really does not help the ambiance of a concrete patio;;;;
7811;i will never rented from them;;;;
7812;my friend lost the key in the car and we were locked out of the car;;;;
7813;i called them but they let us wait for 2 hours and just transfer a key company;;;;
7814;that company required us a annual fee for one time unlocked;;;;
7815;finally we ended up to talk hotel and they called a local key company;;;;
7816;also we made reservation a middle car for $120 but last day they required $210 which include insurance;;;;
7817;even when i called for unlocking key they said we do not have insurance;;;;
7818;be careful about total fee and i do not recommend ask them to rent a car;;;;
7819;i just went there last week and i have no complaints;;;;
7820;i made the appointment online and it was super easy to schedule;;;;
7821;the place is a little hard to find but eventually you can find it;;;;
7822;it's in one building filled with multiple salons;;;;
7823;but kelly did my hair and she was extremely nice and chatty;;;;
7824;i told her what i wanted and she made it happen;;;;
7825;they also didn't nickel and dime me or add on any surprise prices;;;;
7826;will be going back!;;;;
7827;this review is only for take out matza ball soup;;;;
7828;real hot and tasty on rainy day;;;;
7829;some suggestions though;;;;
7830;have sturdier containers for hot soup;;;;
7831;clear plastic are flimsy and can cause burns;;;;
7832;need plastic soup spoons teaspoons say we didn't plan for soup!  also i think cashier said bagel chips come with soup but none were in bag;;;;
7833;indoor parking is the best on rainy days;;;;
7834;a good work in progress;;;;
7835;what's to say! it's a grocery store with what ya need downtown;;;;
7836;it's not hipster or shady;;;;
7837;it's just a good simple grocery store with a great mix of produce organic and other baked goods;;;;
7838;the prices are fair even though some things i know are cheaper elsewhere;;;;
7839;for many of us it means not having to drive so its all good;;;;
7840;3 of us were planning to go to burger bar inside mandalay bay;;;;
7841;but we missed the exit as there was construction and somehow ended up on the 215;;;;
7842;and when we got off we saw chicken bonz;;;;
7843;so instead of fighting the traffic onto the strip we decided to try it out;;;;
7844;price wasn't too bad;;;;
7845;all you can eat wings for like $13;;;;
7846;i had the garlic parmesan which seemed a little bland;;;;
7847;then i tried the hot wings;;;;
7848;and it was kind of spicy;;;;
7849;not too bad;;;;
7850;the ranch was a bit watery;;;;
7851;as the others mentioned these are the big wing versions;;;;
7852;so you get a lot of meat;;;;
7853;i personally prefer the small crispy kind;;;;
7854;for the price it isn't bad;;;;
7855;but it just didnt do it for me;;;;
7856;seems old and tired!   i ate here frequently about 20 years ago and returned for happy hour this year;;;;
7857;this used to be a good place many years ago but too many great restaurants have opened in recent years to eat here;;;;
7858;strange rules about what you can eat in the bar area;;;;
7859;food just meh;;;;
7860;i started going here more than 15 years ago (i think more than 10 for sure);;;;
7861;i was referred here by my relative that knows the now famous clarance the owner of the place;;;;
7862;i told him i am the niece of such and such and he said he remembers them;;;;
7863;i didn't have insurance for glasses then he gave me a very reasonable price;;;;
7864;he is very friendly and chatty and despite our age difference (i am probably not much older than his children) we became quick and great friends;;;;
7865;i even go over just to chat after i got my glasses;;;;
7866;now years later he is still a good friend and everytime i go in he always ask about my grandma;;;;
7867;it is hard to find good service nowadays and he kept it up all these years;;;;
7868;"his business had grown (and i have to admit i had send some friends there also) and you might need to wait a bit longer for his ""personal"" service but the other workers are very nice and helpful too";;;;
7869;his prices are still reasonable and with great selections;;;;
7870;i can't imagine to go anywhere else for glasses now;;;;
7871;i went in to sell 3 nice old pieces of clothing;;;;
7872;they told me after a few hours that they were too stocked up on those specific types of garments;;;;
7873;"i was asked if i would like to ""donate"" them instead";;;;
7874;to which i asked where they will be donated;;;;
7875;she said the salvation army with her arms crossed looking me straight in the eye (both obvious signs of defense and lying);;;;
7876;i gave her the thumbs up shot a smile and left;;;;
7877;i don't really trust them;;;;
7878;not sure but i feel like they are shady and maybe corrupt;;;;
7879;i will probably never go there again;;;;
7880;my clothes are actually going to the salvation army next time;;;;
7881;was recommended to try this place by few people and today was my first time here;;;;
7882;all i can say is i am coming back very soon;;;;
7883;service;;;;
7884;wasn't sure if the guy was the owner but he was friendly and talked story while we waited for our food;;;;
7885;loved it!! food came out within 10 min;;;;
7886;food;;;;
7887;tried hamburger steak and it was so delicious;;;;
7888;gravy/sauce they put on the hamburger steak was perfect! also came with onion rings on top which i love;;;;
7889;chicken katsu was amazing! chicken katsu here is crunchy and surprisingly has a flavor by itself that you really don't need a sauce for it;;;;
7890;best chicken katsu i had;;;;
7891;overall;;;;
7892;it was a journey to get to this place as it took about 30min from my house but the service and food here made it worth the drive;;;;
7893;i also love how they had a poster of keali'i reichel;;;;
7894;(they had other posters but keali'i reichel happens to be my favorite);;;;
7895;place is clean service is fast and friendly and food is delicious;;;;
7896;what more could you ask for?;;;;
7897;services are reasonable priced and they are honest;;;;
7898;they did not try to sell us unnecessary parts or services and they back up their work as well;;;;
7899;"before colburn we had another plumber company (they advertise on the fwy billboards (""yes they can rip you off"") come in to give an estimate";;;;
7900;what they quoted was 200% more expensive then what colburn worked on for us;;;;
7901;i called the office and asked why they are so expensive;;;;
7902;"the person on the phone told us that ""we are the best""";;;;
7903;"well i have to respond ""best at ripping us off!"" and hung up the phone up";;;;
7904;let's just say we will definitely use colburn enterprises again and again;;;;
7905;went to get a cup of coffee and some breakfast;;;;
7906;i expected to wait in a long line but after waiting for over 15 minutes in the drive thru i finally make it up to place my order;;;;
7907;the lady was very rude;;;;
7908;i asked for almond milk she said they're out;;;;
7909;i asked for soy she got loud with me said said we;;;;
7910;are;;;;
7911;out;;;;
7912;of everything;;;;
7913;she could have found a nicer approach instead of yelling at me;;;;
7914;i got to the window to pay for what i was able to order and she told me that if i wanted my food i would need to come inside and leave my dog in the car because it was unsanitary for me to have my 3 lbs yorkie in my lap while she was handling food;;;;
7915;i never heard of anything more stupid in my life;;;;
7916;i won't be going back there;;;;
7917;yeah i hear people always raggin' about the post office but you know what gang? the postal service has the best deal anywhere in the world! you can ship stuff all over the world it is cheaper to use the the us postal servie then any of those private shipping companies - fedex ups dhl;;;;
7918;etc;;;;
7919;last month while i was in las vegas i did a very quick trip just to watch my beloved hawaii warriors play football against unlv;;;;
7920;while i was in las vegas i decided to go up with just a duffle bag for my luggage as i was basically away for just 2;;;;
7921;5 days;;;;
7922;as a professional traveler i like to travel light and if i take something with me on a trip;;;;
7923;i'll be sure to use it!;;;;
7924;"don't you just hate it when you over-carry stuff & not use it? i've learned over the years from all my travels for work to ""travel efficiently"" and i hate carrying extra stuff";;;;
7925;because all you're doing is lugging excessive weight!;;;;
7926;how does the post office come into play?;;;;
7927;well on my trip i decided to got to trader joe's (it's a hawaii thing;;;;
7928;we don't have tj in hawaii);;;;
7929;but that's not it gang;;;;
7930;sure i could have carried some of the stuff i bought home (which i did) but due to security & tsa rules;;;;
7931;"if you buy anything ""liquid"" or ""paste"" it cannot be over 3 oz";;;;
7932;when you do any kind of carry on;;;;
7933;catch my drift???;;;;
7934;so after buying a few bottles of cookie butter for my sweetie (she likes that stuff) i realized i could not carry that onto the plane with me so the next best thing to do;;;;
7935;"yes gang! go to the us post office get one of them free - ""flat rate"" boxes load up all your junk that you bought (and make sure you pack it carefully if it's fragile) then tape it up";;;;
7936;and ship it out to yourself! in this case;;;;
7937;back to da 808!;;;;
7938;whaaaalaaaah! not only was it cheaper to ship (even cheaper than paying for airline luggage which usually runs from $25 to $35 dollars) but you don't have to carry it home either! what a smart hawaiian i am 'eh!!!!! lol!;;;;
7939;so if you folks ever load up on omiyagi when you travel;;;;
7940;may i suggest this method to work around the dilemma you're in;;;;
7941;just an fyi;;;;
7942;large flat rate box cost only $17;;;;
7943;90 to ship;;;;
7944;if it fits;;;;
7945;you can ship!;;;;
7946;medium flat rate box cost only $12;;;;
7947;65 to ship;;;;
7948;and again;;;;
7949;if it fits;;;;
7950;you can ship!;;;;
7951;this post office also has a automated kiosk which is nice because to can still ship items out when the post office is closed or say you come here on a sunday to ship something out (when the post office is closed);;;;
7952;in my case;;;;
7953;i shipped my box out on sunday and used the kiosk! no problemo gang! easy bruddah! winning!!!!;;;;
7954;what a great service that the us postal service provides! mahalo!;;;;
7955;not going into great detail;;;;
7956;but i brought my car in for a problem i knew it had;;;;
7957;they inspected the car and gave me an astronomically high quote on repair;;;;
7958;the staff was very nice and place was clean and neat;;;;
7959;i simply could not afford the price they gave;;;;
7960;after continuing to research the repair needed and shopping around for quotes i know for a fact that these guys quoted double the going rate and what i ended up paying;;;;
7961;anywho there are a ton of great shops out there;;;;
7962;and i'm sure these guys are good too;;;;
7963;but i can't justify paying double;;;;
7964;everything we ordered was completely disgusting;;;;
7965;we ordered from the late night menu i got the veggie fajitas beans and rice;;;;
7966;they left out my tortillas in my togo order the beans and rice were disgusting;;;;
7967;my best friend ordered the fish tacos which ended up being some sort of strange shredded fish;;;;
7968;my boyfriend got the salmon salad which was ok but would've been better but the salmon was dry;;;;
7969;they left out my garlic fries and on top of all of this disgusting food it was 91$!!! i will never eat here ever again;;;;
7970;not a bad place to camp out for a night in cleveland;;;;
7971;the airport shuttle is easy to catch and the employees are friendly;;;;
7972;so i chose this place because they were open at the time i wanted to go pick up dinner at 4pm;;;;
7973;ordered a papaya salad and pad thai;;;;
7974;they asked how i wanted it mild medium or hot;;;;
7975;i stayed safe and said mild for both;;;;
7976;well when i got home and opened up the containers--of which they stupidly put them in one bag-dumb because papaya salad is always cold- i had to remove it in the car before heading home;;;;
7977;the papaya salad was not evenly cut;;;;
7978;their shredder is not working and it is supposed to be picked up like speghetti;;;;
7979;this was clumps of papaya shredded half way;;;;
7980;all i could taste was onion;;;;
7981;onion;;;;
7982;like eating a clumpy mouthful of onion;;;;
7983;horrid;;;;
7984;the pad thai had dry pieces of chicken and zero seasoning;;;;
7985;awful;;;;
7986;crap;;;;
7987;waste of $17;;;;
7988;never be back;;;;
7989;they cannot produce thai food that is worthy;;;;
7990;instead of driving back to the place to return this;;;;
7991;i'm writing this review;;;;
7992;stay away;;;;
7993;should have gone to thai plates or tried another place;;;;
7994;these guys were the only ones open at the time i wanted food;;;;
7995;bad decision;;;;
7996;stay away;;;;
7997;headed to the fridge to eat crackers and cheese;;;;
7998;ticked;;;;
7999;i dined at p;;;;
8000;'s last weekend;;;;
8001;i had heard many great things about their food and service so i had to check it out;;;;
8002;i like the atmosphere of the restaurant and that they have a little pseudo patio as well;;;;
8003;it was nice sitting out there and people watching all of the crazy people who come through the forum shops;;;;
8004;our server was very friendly but did seem a little awkward and didn't make a lot of eye contact;;;;
8005;his recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed all of our food;;;;
8006;i over heard other servers asking tables where they were from and it was a little overboard;;;;
8007;every person who came to a table asked that question;;;;
8008;the poor table next to us must've answered 15 times;;;;
8009;here is a little tip;;;;
8010;if the hostess asks she should then communicate it to the server;;;;
8011;"so when the server approaches the table he/she can say ""hey i heard you are visiting from ____ welcome!"" much more personal";;;;
8012;anyhow on to the food!!;;;;
8013;we started out sharing the french onion soup a caesar salad and the tater tots;;;;
8014;all were delicious;;;;
8015;the croutons were homemade on the salad and very flavorful;;;;
8016;the soup was served in a litte crock and was very cheesy;;;;
8017;the tater tots were not my favorite in town but they are still good;;;;
8018;they are homemade and served with tomato jelly instead of ketchup;;;;
8019;main course;;;;
8020;i had the delmonico ribeye oscar style;;;;
8021;the steak was done perfectly and the crab meat and bernaise were amazing;;;;
8022;i could barely eat 1/2 of my meat!  my guest had the lobster mac n' cheese which is very different but very delicious;;;;
8023;there was plenty of lobster meat and it was a large portion;;;;
8024;there was spinach mushrooms and other things mixed in which is different;;;;
8025;we had a side of asparagus which was amazing;;;;
8026;cooked perfectly al dente;;;;
8027;"we also had the ""canon"" potato on the side upon recommenation from our server";;;;
8028;i am so glad i tried this;;;;
8029;"it is actually an english food called ""bubble and squeak";;;;
8030;""" mashed potatoes are sauteed with bacon and chopped cabbage and then topped with a cheese sauce";;;;
8031;sounds strange but it was a great combination!  i would go back for that dish alone;;;;
8032;for dessert we shared the fresh apple cobbler topped with cinammon ice cream;;;;
8033;it was warm and delicious like an apple pie fresh out of the oven;;;;
8034;overall i love the place;;;;
8035;they have a raw bar that often has happy hour specials for $1 oysters;;;;
8036;it is not too casual but also not fussy;;;;
8037;everyone is very friendly and welcoming and the food is great!;;;;
8038;we were in need of a home inspection for our one year warranty in our new construction home;;;;
8039;clear view was great;;;;
8040;they were prompt professional and thorough;;;;
8041;they found some small but important safety issues that i would have never found on my own;;;;
8042;i am so glad i turned to them!;;;;
8043;it was my first time here and since i just moved to nevada wasn't sure what to expect;;;;
8044;but the staff is super nie and friendly and latasha did an awesome job with my hair;;;;
8045;rob was awesome!  he met us at midnight right away so we could close on a house the next day;;;;
8046;he saved the day and his price was fair;;;;
8047;he even printed/scanned/and emailed everything back to make it more convenient for us;;;;
8048;we would use him again without question;;;;
8049;ugh here we go;;;;
8050;this is my second time ordering from crepe club through postmates;;;;
8051;both times big let down;;;;
8052;i order through postmates several times a week and rarely ever have any issues so i know it's nothing they could of prevented unless the drivers start sampling the food and drinks before delivery;;;;
8053;i ordered the regular chicken florentine - crepe was cold doughy and undercooked;;;;
8054;it was generously stuffed almost too much;;;;
8055;spinach was fresh but not cooked so it was like eating a salad in my crepe;;;;
8056;the mushrooms clearly were canned precooked mushrooms;;;;
8057;i'm not totally offended by them but when you put a ton in a raw crepe;;;;
8058;not really tasty;;;;
8059;iced latte- there is no option to not add flavoring which is baffling in itself;;;;
8060;flavoring should be a option not a requirement;;;;
8061;given i can't stand sugar filled syrup pretending to be caramel in my coffee in the special notes section i specifically asked no flavoring and add a extra shot;;;;
8062;guess who got a caramel syrup latte?  this girl;;;;
8063;why even have the special requests field if you aren't going to read it? this happened the first time i ordered;;;;
8064;i don't know if they can't see the notes or figure it can be put on postmates;;;;
8065;it's all very confusing;;;;
8066;chocolate croissant- tasty seemed fresh;;;;
8067;nothing special but compared to my $10 crepe and watered down overly flavored latte it shined;;;;
8068;dear management read your reviews;;;;
8069;common theme crepes are undercooked;;;;
8070;if you are going to be so bold to name your establishment after a certain food you best knock it out of the park;;;;
8071;ihop makes a better chicken florentine crepe;;;;
8072;that's shameful;;;;
8073;i gave it two shots both were overpriced let downs;;;;
8074;their space can't seem to keep a business longer than 2 years;;;;
8075;i'll be shocked if they stick around;;;;
8076;i loved the ambiance of this restaurant;;;;
8077;the food was amazing and the service was excellent;;;;
8078;we started with the famous roy's hawaiian martini lobster potstickers for apps scallops and swordfish for our entrees and everything was cooked to perfection;;;;
8079;if you are a dessert lover like i am;;;;
8080;especially cake you must try the pineapple upside down cake served a la mode;;;;
8081;so good!  this was  my first time but i will definitely dine at roy's again!;;;;
8082;today we went to rent a unit and the staff there are very friendly and helpful;;;;
8083;the place it self is very nice kept clean;;;;
8084;thanks a lot al and jeff;;;;
8085;i really wanted to love this place- as it's in my neighborhood beautifully decorated with a clean interior and products;;;;
8086;i stopped in before christmas and received a welcoming tour;;;;
8087;i had to get my nails done last week when i was out shopping so i decided to stop in and see if i needed an appointment or if they could take me;;;;
8088;when i walked in all nail techs were sitting around and there were no customers;;;;
8089;the women at the front was flustered that i didn't have an appointment t when i asked if i could get a gel manicure and when again their were no customers;;;;
8090;never did i feel so unwelcome;;;;
8091;i thought about leaving;;;;
8092;finally they took me;;;;
8093;the nail tech complained about the gel on my nails and how tough it was to get off;;;;
8094;she struggled with it;;;;
8095;1 week post manicure;;;;
8096;3 out of my 10 nails have chipped and need to be redone;;;;
8097;lots of kinks for them to work out;;;;
8098;hopefully they do;;;;
8099;no matter how beautiful a space;;;;
8100;customer service as well as product are everything;;;;
8101;so mary and her husband came out and assembled a few pieces;;;;
8102;some large some small;;;;
8103;all in all they did a very good job and were polite;;;;
8104;i think that we extended the same courtesy;;;;
8105;we actually asked them to come back and do another small job;;;;
8106;we needed fixtures attached to all our cabinets and drawers;;;;
8107;mary quoted me a price which i accepted and we agreed on a date;;;;
8108;on the day they were suppose to come out about an hour before our scheduled time mary texted and told me her husband had a flat tire and that they'd be late;;;;
8109;i told her no problem;;;;
8110;i was ok;;;;
8111;then;;;;
8112;silence;;;;
8113;never heard back from her again;;;;
8114;i texted a few more times to reschedule i asked her if everything was alright i even asked if they were ok? i know mary got my messages because i had gotten read receipts;;;;
8115;she just completely ignored me;;;;
8116;it was all very strange;;;;
8117;so for the work they did i'd rate them a four but for the appointment cancellation and non responsiveness id give them  a zero if i could;;;;
8118;stephen w;;;;
8119;"said "" they're real pros"" i beg to differ";;;;
8120;professionals who own and run their business should always respond to it's customers;;;;
8121;this place gets crowded;;;;
8122;waited 20 min for a table at 12;;;;
8123;30pm during the lunch rush;;;;
8124;it clears out after 1;;;;
8125;30pm no waiting after the lunch rush;;;;
8126;the portions are huge here with the typical deli style sandwiches and bagels;;;;
8127;the bakery has great items too;;;;
8128;great columbian street food place;;;;
8129;a lot of options in the place that it's located but i think we chose right;;;;
8130;we got the hot dogs columbian style empanada and yucca;;;;
8131;all great!!;;;;
8132;love this bubble tea shop! green grotto has a very nice and comfortable atmosphere and definitely a place where you can relax and have a drink;;;;
8133;the drinks here are good and the food as well;;;;
8134;they give out free popcorn which is very unique and cool;;;;
8135;the service was great and the workers were also very kind;;;;
8136;this is a great place to go on a small cute date ~;;;;
8137;i would definitely recommend to a friend!;;;;
8138;had a nice date here with the bae on friday night;;;;
8139;we ordered a couple of pints and enjoyed the vibe of this place overall;;;;
8140;to share we decided on the fried jerk chicken wings which were delicious;;;;
8141;bae ordered the baseball steak and i opted for a soup and salad;;;;
8142;i tried a bite of the steak which was very tasty and the side of smashed/fried red potatoes were oh so good;;;;
8143;i enjoyed my french onion soup and arugula salad as well;;;;
8144;i would return if i was in the area again;;;;
8145;neighborhood bar  & grill featuring volleyball courts and outdoor patio/bar;;;;
8146;atmosphere is great but food is just ok;;;;
8147;wings are best bet;;;;
8148;stay away from steaks;;;;
8149;service is sub par at best;;;;
8150;they are nice but there are a ton of waitresses but they still take forever to wait on you and forget refills etc;;;;
8151;bar is empty most of time during summer when everyone is outside playing volleyball;;;;
8152;being a repeat customer i can honestly say that the service and the communication between parties has not changed! excellent as usual and is never a hassle;;;;
8153;people will definitely have a smooth transaction over here;;;;
8154;shout out to mark who helped me out (again);;;;
8155;always a pleasure to be served with ease;;;;
8156;he explained everything accurately;;;;
8157;this is my definite spot when it comes to car service!;;;;
8158;service was great;;;;
8159;the food was disgusting;;;;
8160;ordered clam chowder and it was barely warm;;;;
8161;then ordered fried shrimp and the shrimp was not deveined;;;;
8162;seriously?! i'm paying $18;;;;
8163;99 for fried shrimp with the poop vein still intact?! ugh;;;;
8164;also ordered plain iced tea and it was frothy and super bitter;;;;
8165;definitely not at all impressed and won't be returning;;;;
8166;worst customer service ever had me waiting  a hour and then skips me never coming back do not go there if you want a haircut;;;;
8167;yikes don't try and get a burrito without meat and cheese you would have thought i asked for the moon!  i was told that the cooks would do it this one time but don't come back on the weekend and expect that to happen again;;;;
8168;how hard is it to remove something from an item;;;;
8169;that has to be assembled anyhow?  our waitress made a huge deal out of it and that we should be pretty grateful they were willing to do it;;;;
8170;bricco is a local junction restaurant that i truly would like to support;;;;
8171;but it confuses me;;;;
8172;there is a meticulous attention to detail about restaurant decor;;;;
8173;however in a couple of visits with friends  one of four in the group wasn't happy with what they selected;;;;
8174;while the other three were thrilled;;;;
8175;is the chef inconsistent or just trying too hard to be creative?;;;;
8176;i am always drawn to a menu with wine pairings;;;;
8177;on new year last though bricco had a menu that didn't flow well and some of the wine pairings just didn't make sense to the point of requesting (and thankfully receiving) a replacement wine;;;;
8178;i would have lost hope except the main was a cut of beef with an italian pairing that was to die for!;;;;
8179;lets hope for more consistency and the locals will fill the room;;;;
8180;located next to the costco near woodbine & hwy 7;;;;
8181;looks like lots of people go for dim sum and grocery shopping without having to move the car;;;;
8182;however unless you take advantage of their early bird pricing (we did not) not that great a place for dim sum;;;;
8183;better quality/price choices are readily available;;;;
8184;our party of four paid $57 all in for 8 so-so dim sum dishes plus a noodle plate;;;;
8185;my wife and i flew out to vegas for the 3-day president's day weekend and my 50th birthday;;;;
8186;i reserved the car on-line at hertz a few days earlier;;;;
8187;a mercedes c-class from the prestige collection;;;;
8188;i selected the reserve this exact model option so that we would get a mercedes;;;;
8189;i also signed up for the hertz gold membership so that our car would be ready for us and we would be able to skip the usually long counter lines at the mccarran airport;;;;
8190;none of these things happened;;;;
8191;our reservation was for 3;;;;
8192;at 2;;;;
8193;48 i received an email confirmation that my car was ready for me and even given a stall # to find the car and license plate # to identify the car and even the color-white;;;;
8194;when we got to the stall there was a car but not the car i had reserved and received confirmation for;;;;
8195;so i explain my situation to a couple of workers that were walking by and they tell me that there was a mercedes there earlier but somebody else got it;;;;
8196;somebody else got it?  it was in a stall reserved for me right?;;;;
8197;ok over to the office to stand in line anyway;;;;
8198;the counter worker tells me there are no mercedes available;;;;
8199;i say i reserved one specifically (choose exact model) one was supposedly waiting for me and i had received an email telling me this;;;;
8200;he tells me he has a better car for me;;;;
8201;a cadillac;;;;
8202;we go out to see the cad and i see a mercedes a white one and i ask for it;;;;
8203;he tells me it's held for someone;;;;
8204;i say yah me;;;;
8205;he says he can't do it;;;;
8206;i ask why not;;;;
8207;he says it's on hold for someone else;;;;
8208;i ask why the car i had on hold went to someone else and he could not explain it;;;;
8209;we look at the cad and he tells me there are two to choose from and i would like it better than the mercedes anyway;;;;
8210;is that why there were 2 cadillacs and 0 mercedes available?;;;;
8211;anyway i agreed to take the cadillac but was left wondering what is so great about hertz and their gold club?  i had to wait in line i did not get the car i reserved and was promised;;;;
8212;time to start shopping around for a new rental car company;;;;
8213;ok i've been living in madison for over a year and had been trying to find a place with decent but inexpensive chinese food;;;;
8214;fugu was ok but overpriced and their delivery is slow;;;;
8215;ichiban seemed just ok;;;;
8216;i've tried others with no luck;;;;
8217;finally i tried double 10 and i'm soooooo happy! it's really good but also way cheaper than anything else i've found in town;;;;
8218;i really liked the garlic sauce they have;;;;
8219;they also had super fast service;;;;
8220;this is my new go to chinese place!;;;;
8221;first time here and everything was amazing;;;;
8222;what a wonderful little gem we found in this place;;;;
8223;looks like not much out front but it's very charming and original in back;;;;
8224;beautiful patio and food was fabulous;;;;
8225;lunch today but we will be back to try more;;;;
8226;breakfast looks incredible;;;;
8227;plus they are detroit tiger fans!  added bonus!!!;;;;
8228;picture homer simpson when he sees something really delicious that he wants to eat;;;;
8229;his eyes close a bit his mouth waters profusely and he makes that mouthwatering gargling sound;;;;
8230;do you have the image in your head?  well that's probably me exactly when i think about eating at jimmy's!  it's so delicious that whenever i think about it i have an instant craving!;;;;
8231;the amount of food you get for the price is unbelievable!  the donairs and shawarmas are so big i struggle to finish one;;;;
8232;even when i'm stuffed to the brim i can't bring myself to throw any away so i always make myself sick by force feeding the remaining wrap into my mouth;;;;
8233;i wouldn't for one second dream of wasting a jimmy donair;;;;
8234;i know that everyone who goes here will all be saying the same thing;;;;
8235;it's so delicious and marvelous that nothing else will ever be satisfying again!;;;;
8236;the first time i went in here i had no clue what i was doing or what i wanted to eat;;;;
8237;lucky for me jimmy was behind the counter serving people and he pointed me in the right direction of something yummy;;;;
8238;he was super friendly and extremely helpful;;;;
8239;don't tell jimmy but i kind of have a little crush on him;;;;
8240;maybe that's why i keep going back;;;;
8241;nah it's because of how fantastic the food is;;;;
8242;besides the donairs and shawarmas they also have a bunch of little desserts you can buy;;;;
8243;there is a whole display of baklava and other yummy looking treats;;;;
8244;along with the food jimmy's is also a great place to go if you want to buy some shisha or hookah pipes;;;;
8245;they have a large assortment of different sizes and shapes and all the flavours that you can imagine smoking;;;;
8246;i seriously love jimmy's so much;;;;
8247;i miss the days when a friend used to live behind the store and we ate there almost everyday;;;;
8248;now i have to go a little out of my way to get there but it's totally worth it every time;;;;
8249;i love jimmy's so much and i'm positive that everyone who goes there loves it too;;;;
8250;it's just one of those awesome finds that everyone in the world should know about;;;;
8251;*insert homer simpson drooling here*;;;;
8252;the repair worked for a short time;;;;
8253;they were to fix the spring;;;;
8254;they repaired the spring seemingly but within the year the arm that pulls the door up broke from the door and i had to pay another charge;;;;
8255;within the year the door would not respond to detaching the arm with the power was out;;;;
8256;now we are over to the next year;;;;
8257;my door tore up!!!  the arm detached a panel was split and the metal folded;;;;
8258;i called the company back and i got the;;;;
8259;you must pay us once again to come out and improperly fix your door;;;;
8260;i called the original overhead door company;;;;
8261;they were more expensive but you get what you pay for;;;;
8262;they repaired the door by reinforcing what the arm was attached to;;;;
8263;what did they say;;;;
8264;the arm was improperly attached that the door and the iron should have never folded like it did;;;;
8265;thankfully my door is still good but needs new panels as they were split and new iron across the bar as it was bent;;;;
8266;pretty bad;;;;
8267;was this place good at one time? for the price i paid i expected something much better;;;;
8268;two kids and an adult on a friday nught;;;;
8269;$86;;;;
8270;unbelievable;;;;
8271;no selection of food;;;;
8272;quality of food sucks;;;;
8273;only thing good was almond bread pudding;;;;
8274;new management sucks;;;;
8275;i used to get my nails done here all the time but now they do a horrible job;;;;
8276;first time eating here;;;;
8277;excellent bagels and i have lived in montreal! lol;;;;
8278;also lots of seating inside;;;;
8279;i had bagel lox and cream cheese and let me tell you it ranks up top with the best of them;;;;
8280;very friendly staff too;;;;
8281;highly recommend and will return;;;;
8282;even though a few flavours have been hit or miss for me here (maple was meh and there was a weird aftertaste to mint chocolate chip) i still look forward to trying flavours out from here because when the flavour is right on it's amazing;;;;
8283;i went to pep boys at 6pm on the saturday of thansgiving weekend when everything else was closed;;;;
8284;so first off the store hours and accessibility in times of need was awesome;;;;
8285;herold was the customer services rep who helped us out and he was a very very big help;;;;
8286;he got everything done and really understood the urgency of the problem (i had to drive 550 miles to sc the next day);;;;
8287;he was delightful to talk to and was very patient and understanding as well;;;;
8288;dustin was the technical rep who handled my case and was very helpful as well;;;;
8289;he really understood my budget limits and had very affordable solutions to my problems;;;;
8290;i would rate these guys 5 stars because of the professional friendly and understanding way in which they handled the matter;;;;
8291;oh and we were also able to get big discounts on parts and labor which is always awesome;;;;
8292;thank you so much pep boys (especially herold and dustin) noone else has ever responded to an sos call like you did;;;;
8293;a hidden gem! initially i thought this was a drive thru coffee stand;;;;
8294;to my surprise they serve breakfast lunch dinner and happy hour;;;;
8295;an adorable pet friendly patio that was busy what look like with local patrons;;;;
8296;inside tables and bar seating;;;;
8297;cozy fit and counter service for lunch;;;;
8298;check out the unique bathroom;;;;
8299;the entire staff was extremely friendly and going the extra mile to make every guest welcome;;;;
8300;great location and nice employees;;;;
8301;one of their managers kevin helped us one time and he was incredibly knowledgeable about the item we were looking for as well as the layout of the store;;;;
8302;it was great!;;;;
8303;this place was really small but i loved it it was comfortable and a friendly environment;;;;
8304;the kitchen is right there its amazing you can see what they are doing the only thing that could be off putting is that this is arizona and it is summer so watching from the kitchen bar can get pretty warm but then just don't sit there;;;;
8305;my good friend loves the place and found it a few years before;;;;
8306;so he recommended a few things we had a bottle of riesling with our baked bree and blackberry (i think it was jam) it was amazing;;;;
8307;truly and i am very particular about the types of cheese i'm okay with (food allergies);;;;
8308;we were just catching up so we didn't decide immediately that we would stay for dinner but why not i choose the pasta with lobster in an amazing carrot butter sauce and he had the standing shepard's pie you have to see it to believe how amazing it is;;;;
8309;our food was amazing we had a second bottle of wine which was also amazing and although my friend finished all of his food i've never been able to finish a full plate of pasta in one sitting so i brought some home;;;;
8310;i actually ate the left overs which is unlike me;;;;
8311;the owner talked to us for a bit he was really helpful talked to me a bit about my emerging interests in making wine/beer and different outlets that would be helpful and reasonably priced;;;;
8312;i didn't expect that it was really nice of him to talk about their wide selection of wines beers and other interesting concoctions;;;;
8313;i wish that i had more time to try a couple of them;;;;
8314;i will have to go back sometime soon;;;;
8315;i initially passed the place up since it is nestled in a typical strip mall off next to a kinko's just off rural road on e university;;;;
8316;i was meeting a friend for a quick inexpensive and hopefully tasty pre-movie dinner at the valley art theater on mill;;;;
8317;"the decor was what i would call the ""basic no frills cafeteria like set up"" that can be found in many indian and thai restaurants i have frequented";;;;
8318;practical and comfortable;;;;
8319;the staff was friendly and welcoming and the menu had typical indian fare;;;;
8320;we shared the appetizers the garlic naan and vegetable samosas both were an enjoyable beginning;;;;
8321;i love eggplant so my go to order is the baingan bharta with rice and that is what i had;;;;
8322;it was delicious i ordered it mild and it had just the right amount of kick;;;;
8323;i restrained myself from not devouring the whole meal and saved enough to take home for a full meal;;;;
8324;as expected the meal was a great value of $20 with tip;;;;
8325;not bad for two healthy meals;;;;
8326;when i am craving indian and over near mill i will return to the delhi palace again;;;;
8327;namaste;;;;
8328;i have ordered from here 5 times;;;;
8329;each time a different sandwich;;;;
8330;greasy soaked texas style toast and bland as ever;;;;
8331;they could have put anything on it to be honest it tasted like hot grease;;;;
8332;perfect for those who like indigestion and stomach pain;;;;
8333;over-hyped restaurant not worth the visit;;;;
8334;this place rocks my world!!!! the servers are super friendly and the food is fantastic;;;;
8335;i come here about 2 times a week and am extremely satisfied every time;;;;
8336;they have a great happy hour too! denise and maggie are the best!;;;;
8337;holy crap what's with the bad reviews? i can't believe that this is the same place we ate dinner at last night!;;;;
8338;we came around 5 pm ans sat on the patio;;;;
8339;we had several servers come and ask if we were ready to order but we weren't;;;;
8340;we wanted fried calamari and also some hot apps but the hot platter for 2 only had the grilled calamari;;;;
8341;our server was nice enough to substitute the fried calamari for us at no extra charge;;;;
8342;i had a glass of nice refreshing greek white that hit the spot;;;;
8343;the greek salad we had was super fresh and crunchy with a perfect dressing and just the right amount of feta;;;;
8344;the platter had 2 dolomades that were very good and had a nice mint flavour behind the grape leaf;;;;
8345;the house made sausage had loads of lemon zest in it and was exceptionally flavourful;;;;
8346;spanakopita was flaky buttery and delicious and the octopus was nice too;;;;
8347;i have to say that the calamari was not as tender as i would have expected but it wasn't terrible;;;;
8348;they also brought us some delicious hummus that was made with fresh chickpeas;;;;
8349;they also brought a nice helping of yummy tatziki on a plate;;;;
8350;the service was exceptional and we rarely waited for anything we needed;;;;
8351;our server asked my boyfriend if he wanted another diet coke she cleared our cutlery from the greek salad and replaced it when our platter came;;;;
8352;maybe it was a fluke but we had an absolutely great little nosh and i'd come back again anytime;;;;
8353;not the chipotle it used to be compared to couple years back;;;;
8354;they are stingy with everything now;;;;
8355;i barely come here anymore it used to be 2-3 times a week;;;;
8356;step it up you are a big franchise now;;;;
8357;love this hidden gem!  the food is excellent well-presented and affordable;;;;
8358;i have tried the kiss taco kiss papa taco and kiss salad;;;;
8359;all delicious!!;;;;
8360;active renter manages all my property in phoenix/scottsdale;;;;
8361;i chose them over several other companies because they are honest hard-working individuals who operate their business with integrity and professionalism;;;;
8362;they manage my property so well i never have to worry about the details;;;;
8363;and as an out-of-state property owner i don't want to worry and have extra hassles!  they take care of everything every step of the way;;;;
8364;their communications are clear concise timely and professional;;;;
8365;i will never switch and go to another company because i am so convinced i am getting honest and impeccable service from active renter at a very reasonable cost;;;;
8366;as for the tenants who are complaining i am hard-pressed to believe that rich and the entire active renter crew have treated anyone poorly or have not serviced rentals in a timely manner;;;;
8367;there are also people who tear up property (not their property!!) and then complain when they get billed for all the damages;;;;
8368;these are probably the same tenants who punch holes in dry wall steal furnaces (who does that!?!?!?!) damage landscaping tear up concrete driveways etc;;;;
8369;#NAME?;;;;
8370;it's said that people who have negative comments are much more likely to post a review than people with positive comments - on a 9 to 1 basis!  so for every complaint remember there are dozens hundreds perhaps even thousands of individuals who have wonderfully positive things to say about active renter but just don't take the time to post a review;;;;
8371;from either the property management or the leasing side i don't think you'll get better service anywhere than active renter provides;;;;
8372;i would recommend them - without reservation - to any family member friend and/or colleague;;;;
8373;they are the best in the business and their high rate of growth is proof positive they are the best property management company around;;;;
8374;you can't go wrong with active renter;;;;
8375;they are the real deal;;;;
8376;if i could give them 10 stars i would!  they are that awesome!;;;;
8377;and i just have to add that the individuals who are posting negative comments sound childish and immature in their reviews;;;;
8378;resorting to name-calling (snake with legs!?!?!?!?!) and foul language is a sure sign of someone throwing a tantrum when asked to be accountable for their actions;;;;
8379;look at their other reviews and you might see a pattern;;;;
8380;great beer;;;;
8381;matt cole has matured into a great craftsmen;;;;
8382;food is pretty good overall;;;;
8383;smokehouse wings are the best in c-town;;;;
8384;the brewben is one of the best sandwiches i've ever had;;;;
8385;the root beer floats are an old timey treat for desert;;;;
8386;giant portions,be warned;;;;
8387;very pleased with everything i've bought here;;;;
8388;scallops salmon halibut trout;;;;
8389;the owner provides great customer service;;;;
8390;they just started carrying low acid coffee which we used to have to buy from trader joes in chicago;;;;
8391;ask to receive the fish and meat emails;;;;
8392;it's pretty rare for me to write fast food reviews;;;;
8393;but considering i have always have superb experiences it's only fair to give them the credit they deserve;;;;
8394;as far as i know until now vegas only had one freddy's location;;;;
8395;i was stoked to find out the new one was opening near me;;;;
8396;for me fast food consists of maybe 5 places- and this is one of them;;;;
8397;they serve steak-burgers so it may cost more than average but not by much;;;;
8398;you can get 2 different styles of burgers;;;;
8399;a freddy's burger that comes with pickle mustard and onion;;;;
8400;(my preference) or a california burger;;;;
8401;"same meat but this one comes with lettuce tomato onion and a ""freddy's sauce"" which is your typical thousand island fry sauce spread etc";;;;
8402;they also offer chicago style hot dogs grilled chicken sandwiches and desserts;;;;
8403;the service is always without a doubt amazing;;;;
8404;they train the employees well and it shows;;;;
8405;good quality good prices and good people;;;;
8406;do yourself a favor and skip wendy's mcdonald's and for sure pass by the taco bell next to this place you won't regret it;;;;
8407;this gold's is a pretty good gym;;;;
8408;for the price;;;;
8409;i just have the cheapest membership which is all i need;;;;
8410;when you join they do snake a few charges on you that you don't expect but everybody who gets your credit card does that nowadays don't they? basic membership probably comes out to around $170 a year and that's not bad at all;;;;
8411;i've been to this gym around 40 times in the last couple of months;;;;
8412;i've never seen any member nor staff clean the equipment so make sure you wipe down before your set;;;;
8413;they do have staff clean the facility empty trash fix broken equipment which is the way it should be;;;;
8414;the gym gets very crowded at times i think the local football team got a discount to workout there lol;;;;
8415;"so yeah on weeknights there's a bunch of high schoolers ""working out"" their smartphones trying to be cool in front of their friends";;;;
8416;still when it's super crowded i can usually get my workout in i just have to be flexible and creative;;;;
8417;if the place was empty it'd be really boring so there's always a positive spin to everything;;;;
8418;almost everybody behaves and they're willing to share equipment;;;;
8419;there's no problem with the staff they are definitely friendly which is a big plus;;;;
8420;overall i give this gym 3 stars;;;;
8421;it's a good gym with a lively atmosphere and you can get your workout in with relative ease;;;;
8422;i'd give it a higher rating if they(somebody/anybody) cleaned the equipment and if they didn't sneak all those charges within the first couple of weeks;;;;
8423;you just know they'll add some hidden charges at the end too;;;;
8424;i'd come here for dinner before and had a great meal but closer to when it first opened;;;;
8425;this time i tried lunch and did not have as wonderful of an experience;;;;
8426;i ordered the antipasto to start and it was served in a bowl almost as a salad on greens;;;;
8427;it had about 3 very small pieces of italian sausage 2 thin slices of prosciutto just grilled zucchini as far as grilled vegetables and was mostly greens;;;;
8428;this was not at all a good value for the money or what i expect when i order antipasto;;;;
8429;i ordered the gnocchi a la trio for my entree which was an item with a description that sounded amazing;;;;
8430;however the sauce was way too thin and the whole meal was fairly bland;;;;
8431;which is especially odd since it was supposed to be a gorgonzola cream sauce which i expected to be very flavourful;;;;
8432;on another note the manager/possible owner who was walking around seemed to run the place with an iron fist and simply not be a very nice person;;;;
8433;"at one point i heard him chew out a chef about how ""when i say something that's it";;;;
8434;there's no discussion;;;;
8435;""" interestingly he checked in with us mid-meal and was very friendly but his repor with his employees did not put be at ease and i'm less likely to visit a place because of that";;;;
8436;i've rated trio 3* which is actually pretty generous considering my experience;;;;
8437;however the waiters were very kind and attentive and the dessert was delicious (tiramisu);;;;
8438;that coupled with my original visit mean i'll probably try this place out at least one more time to see if i just caught them on a bad day;;;;
8439;no stars;;;;
8440;yes no stars;;;;
8441;(the app made me select one to post) the complete bs i just witnessed as a customer left me with a real stale taste in my mouth;;;;
8442;this is the first dine in experience where the stale taste wasn't caused by the food;;;;
8443;i went with my family to this location for lunch;;;;
8444;the place was busy which is exactly what any good store manager would want;;;;
8445;however a good store manager would also want their customers leaving there location feeling respected valued & fully satisfied with their dine in experience;;;;
8446;our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes;;;;
8447;we usually frequent the parmatown location;;;;
8448;they seem so much more professional;;;;
8449;when our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap;;;;
8450;as you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts;;;;
8451;the shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor;;;;
8452;"my wife received a borage of ""i'm sorry!""s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time";;;;
8453;the most important question or worry during this situation is #1 how does the customer feel? #2 how can we help them? #3 what can we do to rectify the situation? in retrospect all we received was late food apologies wet pants napkins and a bill to pay for it all;;;;
8454;yes a bill! the manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop;;;;
8455;not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal;;;;
8456;i as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution;;;;
8457;some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don't;;;;
8458;this type of manager is what i commonly refer to as a floater;;;;
8459;floaters are managers who do just enough to maintain current numbers and current status quo;;;;
8460;they really have no talent or abilities which are beneficial to improving the overall profitability or running of the store;;;;
8461;when this location implements points #1,#2 &#3 they will be taking a step in the right direction;;;;
8462;it is needless to say that we won't be back anytime soon nor recommending it;;;;
8463;i had heard that this place has very good breakfast with quality ingredients and low prices;;;;
8464;however my husband is not a breakfast person so if you go at dinner time breakfast is still available which is something i need to remember;;;;
8465;we went on a friday after a long stressful week where we had our wedding coming up a week later  and it provided comfort food for us typically not what we would normally have but it hit the spot;;;;
8466;i had the fried chicken and waffles so a little dinner and breakfast in one and my husband had the smaller chicken fried steak;;;;
8467;the portions were large;;;;
8468;the service was very good and the food came out hot and quick;;;;
8469;the decor is very cute;;;;
8470;it looks like you are in a cozy cabin;;;;
8471;i will def be going back for my comfort food fix!;;;;
8472;amazing! we moved to a new house and wanted to protect it;;;;
8473;after researching several security companies i spoke with steve from smart security who came out and looked everything over;;;;
8474;he is like a consultant for our security needs because he made sure to tell us what was needed but he also told us what was not needed so we didn't waste our money;;;;
8475;this was invaluable;;;;
8476;then our job was more difficult because of the way the home was designed but steve put in a lot of time including on the weekend to make sure it was done right (this included cameras and glass break detection etc);;;;
8477;stop looking around and call them you will be glad you did;;;;
8478;i've been there twice;;;;
8479;the first time i got a load of pastries to go (which turned out to be yummy!) and the second time i went for breakfast;;;;
8480;both times the service was great and the food was great;;;;
8481;"i don't know what it's called but there's a filo dough ""tube"" filled w/ spinach and cheeses";;;;
8482;get it!  their signage is practically non-existent so they're unfortunately easy to miss;;;;
8483;it's worth a visit;;;;
8484;we have been searching for a good chinese restaurant that won't break the bank;;;;
8485;we found it! chin's is amazing! 3 of us went out to eat and all got a different dish and upgraded to the vegetable rice;;;;
8486;add 3 drinks and 6 cream cheese wontons and our bill was $33;;;;
8487;the food was spectacular!;;;;
8488;a co-worker of mine kept talking about tottie's so last night i finally gave it a try;;;;
8489;i don't know if it is different dining in because i ordered take-out but it was good;;;;
8490;it didn't blow me away but it was good;;;;
8491;very similar to good chinese take-out or maybe a notch up;;;;
8492;i ordered the tottie rolls as a starter;;;;
8493;they are crispy egg rolls that you wrap in a lettuce leaf with mint and parsley;;;;
8494;they come with a sort-of sweet and sour sauce for dipping that was quite nice;;;;
8495;or atleast i think that is how you are supposed to eat them?  i had a big take out container full of lettuce mint and parsley so i figured that was the drill since i didn't order a salad?  they were good;;;;
8496;i ordered the tangerine chicken and the beef pad lard na;;;;
8497;the chicken dish was good tasted like an orange chicken deep fried until crispy then tossed in a sweet tangerine sauce;;;;
8498;it had a few strips of red bell pepper also;;;;
8499;the beef dish i liked a little more it was the wide egg noodles and had chunks of beef onion pea pods and bok choy in a really good brown sauce;;;;
8500;you can order many of the dishes mild to hot so i did a medium hot since i sharing the dishes i didn't want to blow them out of the water with too spicy of a dish;;;;
8501;next time i will definitely go hotter!  the dishes came with 2 containers of sticky white rice which was exactly what it sounds like;;;;
8502;i didn't have any dessert but the crispy bananas sound great and i am interested in trying the ice creams i keep hearing about;;;;
8503;i also really want to try the soups they sound good;;;;
8504;all in all it was good (i keep saying good!)  the prices are reasonable and the portions are big;;;;
8505;i have enough for lunch leftovers today;;;;
8506;so it is worth giving them a try and i will be back;;;;
8507;pvsec was amazing when our family dog was attacked by a deer;;;;
8508;they took excellent care of our dog and provided constant updates and visits to make us feel as comfortable as possible during a traumatic time;;;;
8509;the staff and doctors were wonderful;;;;
8510;i was even able to call in the middle of the night and speak to a staff member about how our dog was doing;;;;
8511;everyone clearly loves animals who worked there and made it as easy as possible on our family;;;;
8512;they even provided help locating another 24 hour emergency clinic when our dog relapsed a few months later while we were on vacation out of state;;;;
8513;would highly recommend this clinic to care for your furry friend;;;;
8514;food is still excellent! service is still meh! prices and portions are still a disappointment!;;;;
8515;pretty good food, about the same as other vietnamese food i've had before;;;;
8516;the place its self is really nice;;;;
8517;stands out in a pretty old and gritty neighborhood;;;;
8518;got a bowl with spring rolls with chicken and beef;;;;
8519;by the end i was full and just for $10;;;;
8520;delicious;;;;
8521;offcourse fruity but its about the experience of a complete flavour;;;;
8522;served with good vibes gracias;;;;
8523;we just recently purchased a house with a pool;;;;
8524;being first time home and pool owners we want to make sure we are doing it correctly;;;;
8525;i've taken my water to be tested here multiple times and each time they act as if it's a great inconvenience for them to spend a minute testing the water;;;;
8526;customer service seems severely lacking and often feels like they just want you to leave when you walk in;;;;
8527;they don't greet you as enter and give half hearted answers to your questions;;;;
8528;if you're looking for good service and knowledge please avoid this place;;;;
8529;i for one will be looking for a new pool supply store;;;;
8530;very slow and incompetent staff;;;;
8531;food is okay nothing special;;;;
8532;i would definitely avoid this place next time i'm in vegas;;;;
8533;good food and nice clean place;;;;
8534;"i ate the ""buffalo soldier"" there and took a ""sweet home alabama"" home";;;;
8535;yum;;;;
8536;i love southview and i don't think i'd ever say i love a dentists' office;;;;
8537;every member of the staff is extremely friendly and courteous;;;;
8538;no matter what time of day i am there everyone is (or pretends to be) in the best mood ever;;;;
8539;very professional very clean and modern even relaxing!;;;;
8540;everyone was upfront with pricing they wanted to make me feel as comfortable as possible (massage options in the chair? tvs above you? headphones for the tv? yes please!) and even though i know they're churning through patients i never feel rushed out the door if i have questions or concerns;;;;
8541;after my initial consultation there i've had my teeth cleaned old fillings repaired and even some new cavities filled;;;;
8542;they use a three-part numbing process so i've never had issues with pain;;;;
8543;my only complaint is sometimes especially towards the end of the year appointments are hard to book - but that's kind of how it goes most places;;;;
8544;definitely recommend them!;;;;
8545;i was really disappointed with my most recent visit to vintage 95;;;;
8546;i make it out there every six months or so and always talk it up to friends;;;;
8547;tonight i went with my husband and in-laws;;;;
8548;we ordered a carafe of sangria which as always was top notch;;;;
8549;my in-laws ordered bruschetta - they ended up with a ton of untoasted bread with a very thin coat of ricotta and a light topping of good quality tomatoes;;;;
8550;tasty but not bruschetta and definitely not worth $14;;;;
8551;"my husband and i got the ""artisan board"" with one meat and one cheese";;;;
8552;for $13 we got a teeny tiny piece of cheese four thin slices of not-so-good sopressata stale bread 2 crackers raw unsalted almonds six grapes and about half a jar of very oniony cornichons! the food was a huge rip-off and not at all the quality or quantity we have gotten in the past;;;;
8553;the saving grace of the night was the sangria which i still think is one of the best in the area;;;;
8554;but overall i don't think this place is worth a trip out anymore;;;;
8555;clean and comfortable;;;;
8556;nice hot breakfast available - eggs bacon oatmeal fruit pancakes cinnamon rolls yogurt biscuits and gravy;;;;
8557;also has a small (somewhat dated) exercise facility and outdoor pool;;;;
8558;ac made some screeching noises at night that woke me up;;;;
8559;otherwise a nice stay;;;;
8560;shuttle to airport was handy;;;;
8561;i feel like friday's food menu has gotten worse over the years;;;;
8562;the alcohol menu - big improvements i mean who wouldn't want a 'diddy up' - right?!;;;;
8563;this particular location is hit or miss with the waitstaff - some act like they love their jobs others look like they hate their lives;;;;
8564;past couple of times i've been there the food came out lukewarm at best;;;;
8565;yesterday it just so happened that i found a lemon seed in my brushetta chicken pasta after almost cracking a tooth on it ew;;;;
8566;although i will say i just moved that bad boy to the side and acted like i never saw it;;;;
8567;it's probably better that way;;;;
8568;the seating arrangements are like any other friday's;;;;
8569;booths tables a bar;;;;
8570;some of their 'four person' booths would probably be better suited for 2 people or perhaps small children - you won't find any arm room or a place to set your purse here;;;;
8571;sometimes they run dinner specials - an appetizer entrã©e & dessert - somewhere around $11;;;;
8572;99 or they've got some 2 for $20 deals;;;;
8573;i'll come back but only because it's cheap-ish & close to home;;;;
8574;had a groupon so it was a good price;;;;
8575;variety of balls available if you dont have your own;;;;
8576;you need to use an 8 lb ball if you want bumpers;;;;
8577;our lane broke down repeatedly it even gave up and powered itself off one time;;;;
8578;we ate there yesterday for the first time;;;;
8579;my husband ordered fish tacos and i had the five shrimp with sticky rice;;;;
8580;he loved his dish;;;;
8581;the fish had a nice slightly spicy sauce on them;;;;
8582;it was mahi mahi;;;;
8583;the shredded veggies were also just perfect;;;;
8584;he said he would order it again;;;;
8585;i also liked the dish i had;;;;
8586;the asparagus was delightful;;;;
8587;the rice section was very bland but our waitress brought some soy sauce for me;;;;
8588;this improved everything;;;;
8589;i would just ask for soy sauce when ordering this dish again;;;;
8590;i would order it again;;;;
8591;we also shared a small dessert in a glass;;;;
8592;it was boston cream pie;;;;
8593;very tasty;;;;
8594;i was happy they had the nice little desserts;;;;
8595;anything else would have been too much;;;;
8596;it was perfect;;;;
8597;we will definitely go back;;;;
8598;the prices were very reasonable;;;;
8599;i have never waited less than forty five minutes to see my doctor;;;;
8600;while the staff are competent and i'm satisfied with the quality of care i've received the constant over booking definitely soils my opinion;;;;
8601;people go to spine specialists because they're  in pain;;;;
8602;making patients wait for extended periods of time in terribly uncomfortable chairs is painfully ironic;;;;
8603;please stop over booking;;;;
8604;we all know it's nothing more than greed to bill more appointments per day;;;;
8605;i am short;;;;
8606;pants are always waaaay too long;;;;
8607;i have been taking my pants and jeans to maria since we moved to this area 4 years ago;;;;
8608;she always does a wonderful job and is very upfront about her pricing;;;;
8609;i would be heartbroken if she ever closed up shop;;;;
8610;great ambiance great food although their policy of no reservations can be a drag;;;;
8611;great place for ribs;;;;
8612;they are so tender they fall off the bone;;;;
8613;i always order the louisiana chicken;;;;
8614;a flattened chicken breast smothered with grilled vegetables and goat cheese;;;;
8615;goat cheese is like bacon;;;;
8616;it just makes everything better;;;;
8617;also try their artichoke dip as an appetizer;;;;
8618;it is the best out there;;;;
8619;on our last visit ( less than a week ago) ,their baked beans were different;;;;
8620;hopefully it was just a hiccup because they are usually incredible;;;;
8621;service is always excellent and the prices are reasonable considering portion size;;;;
8622;excellente place que vous passiez juste prendre un bon thã© ou cafã© ou que vous vouliez vous asseoir et manger un brownie dã©cadent ou un grill cheese aux oignons caramã©lisã©s;;;;
8623;le personnel est sympathique pas stressã© et ne met pas de pression pour consommer;;;;
8624;les enfants sont les trã¨s bienvenus et ont de quoi s occuper!!;;;;
8625;my boyfriend and i were really looking forward to a couple's massage on our vegas trip this memorial day weekend;;;;
8626;i researched a lot of spas and reviews before choosing episage and i'm so glad i made the right decision;;;;
8627;first of all i called 5 different times to see if i could reschedule our appointment since our flight and times wouldn't allow us to make our original one;;;;
8628;each time they tried to find a new opening for us and even a few hours before we went they scheduled us on a sunday after i called;;;;
8629;nikki and limmie were our therapists;;;;
8630;they went above and beyond expectations for a massage!! they set the music to that that would fit my bf and i perfectly;;;;
8631;they taught us (mistly my bf) all about tight and knotted fascia and stretching;;;;
8632;limmie went through a number of stretches and flexibility therapies on me;;;;
8633;they had us laughing and having a good time the entire session and we got educated without even realizing we were getting educated;;;;
8634;my boyfriend is making sure he's stretching and treating his body better now after the session with nikki and limmie and i now can't wait to come back to vegas just to go see them for another massage! best hour and a half ever! you won't be disappointed!!;;;;
8635;not bad at all;;;;
8636;the standard dishes - chinese broccoli xiu mai ha cao chicken feet black bean pork ribs steamed bbq pork bun shrimp wrapped in thick rice noodle chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle - were all a-ok;;;;
8637;the rice and chicken served in a vertical bamboo cup was tasty;;;;
8638;flavors were similar to vietnamese 'com ga' with ginger light soy and chicken;;;;
8639;the xiu mai had orange/yellow 'eggs' on it which tasted like crab innards/tomal/mustard;;;;
8640;rich and super flavorful;;;;
8641;all the dumplings were packed with meat and/or seafood and not a lot of fillers (yay!);;;;
8642;the only downside is that the offerings are limited/uninspired;;;;
8643;just the basics;;;;
8644;i'd come back if i were in lv and craving dim sum;;;;
8645;other important info;;;;
8646;small establishment push cart servers prices are higher than ca but definitely reasonable located inside gold coast hotel off the strip next to rio and across from the palms;;;;
8647;i ordered the heart shaped pizza and meatball sliders on v-day and it really hit the spot;;;;
8648;my honey and i both had to work but wanted something easy that maintains the v-day spirit;;;;
8649;why not a heart shaped pizza? they had a special of a large heart shape with an extra topping for about $20 with tax;;;;
8650;pretty good deal!;;;;
8651;if you don't already know metro pizza serves up a pretty yum pie;;;;
8652;i am familiar with a few of their locations and this one did not taint the reputation;;;;
8653;my favorite thing from metro however is not the pizza;;;;
8654;it is their meatball sliders with fries;;;;
8655;bomb! yummy meatball sheltered in a garlic knot yas please! they are soooo good! the fries is really good too;;;;
8656;only complaint fries portion shrinks every time we order the sliders;;;;
8657;please don't skimp on the fries!;;;;
8658;my experience with metro is solely based on take out;;;;
8659;i need to plan a time to dine-in;;;;
8660;i knew coming here there would be a long line;;;;
8661;we waited about 25 mins which isn't too bad;;;;
8662;there is a menu displayed around the corner so it is nice to look at what you want to order before you get to the cashier;;;;
8663;"we got the infamous ""slut,"" fairfax sandwich and some orange juice";;;;
8664;the orange juice taste so good! so refreshing and taste fresh squeeze! the slut is pretty good its eggs and mash potatoes with bread to dip;;;;
8665;the sandwiches are amazing and the fairfax doesn't disappoint;;;;
8666;i still think of the bread and how soft it is!;;;;
8667;just give it a try you won't be disappointed;;;;
8668;wow;;;;
8669;no reviews on here yet? i am surprised;;;;
8670;i love this gym;;;;
8671;i like a lot of gyms but i love this gym!;;;;
8672;i started training with bobby at results only right before my wedding and within 10 weeks of working out with bobby i lost about 15 lbs and 1 dress size;;;;
8673;my husband had similiar results;;;;
8674;my arms never looked better;;;;
8675;i was sincerely a beautiful bride;;;;
8676;at age 43 i looked better at this wedding than my 1st one!;;;;
8677;when we first started looking at gyms we were struggling with how to fit in everything we were looking for in a gym;;;;
8678;times of classes co-ed so we both could attend small enough for personalized attention motivating enough to keep us coming back and fun;;;;
8679;we hate working out so if we were going to avoid going out for drinks and dinner we needed some serious motivation;;;;
8680;the group training is co-ed the classes are offered at the perfect times for our schedule the gym is near our home and the owner bobby is crazy funny and terribly motivating - he keeps us going!;;;;
8681;but;;;;
8682;i really knew that results only fit our family and our lifestyle when bobby introduced his teen fitness program to my son! bobby was an instant hit with my pre-teen and now he is eagerly getting in shape and learning about fitness gaining confidence and having fun at results only;;;;
8683;we are hooked;;;;
8684;i can't imagine where we would find a gym like this and i have tried quite a few gyms in the valley - and have great things to say about many of them - but bobby has offered us the most for our family and delivered the highest level of results;;;;
8685;thanks bobby;;;;
8686;from all of us! i can't wait to see what we look like on our wedding anniversary!;;;;
8687;they have good chicken and bomb biscuits when fresh;;;;
8688;i just hate the service and paying for sauce;;;;
8689;i mean i just bought a 12 pc bucket can i have atleast one sauce? i understand if i didn't buy chicken but whatever lol end rant;;;;
8690;just pulled up about 20 minutes ago and no one was at the drive-thru pulled up again because they appeared after we were gone;;;;
8691;took them about 5 minutes to take our order;;;;
8692;in addition she was giving attitude because we said hello due to bad audio coming through;;;;
8693;i only gave 1 star because we actually got our food;;;;
8694;very irritated and disappointed;;;;
8695;been a while since we came here but loved it;;;;
8696;little bit loud but ok and maybe not as fancy as some of its other locations (chicago miami) but;;;;
8697;#NAME?;;;;
8698;#NAME?;;;;
8699;great menu right now they have to choose from;;;;
8700;seems the same in all cities for the moment;;;;
8701;food was good but  took forever;;;;
8702;it seemed like they needed more help;;;;
8703;20 minutes for not being that busy;;;;
8704;hopefully next visit is better;;;;
8705;excellent coffee cake like to die for!! tortilla soup was a major hit! great experience for first day in vegas!;;;;
8706;read the reviews and thought i would try it;;;;
8707;yelpers were on point with this one;;;;
8708;good asian fare reasonably priced and nice portions;;;;
8709;food was very fresh tasting and seasoning not overpowering;;;;
8710;i will definitely come back;;;;
8711;service was great also;;;;
8712;this is a hidden gem in the hard rock!;;;;
8713;this is my favorite park in vegas!;;;;
8714;2016 yelp 100 review challenge -     12/100;;;;
8715;i've heard about this park from family and friends over the years but didn't experience it myself till sometime last year;;;;
8716;after that i began coming here for my morning cardio (walk/run/hike) several days a week;;;;
8717;i agree with many of the reviews for this park;;;;
8718;it has a little bit of everything and more;;;;
8719;#NAME?;;;;
8720;#NAME?;;;;
8721;i've seen some photographers do their photo sessions here;;;;
8722;#NAME?;;;;
8723;it's a great hike if you want to do a solo hike in the morning;;;;
8724;every morning that i've been here there were others hiking the trail doing their morning cardio/workouts as well;;;;
8725;so i felt safe knowing that there were others around if i accidentally fell or what not;;;;
8726;#NAME?;;;;
8727;it's just dirt and gravel;;;;
8728;so be careful;;;;
8729;#NAME?;;;;
8730;(not recommended for beginners;;;;
8731;check out the trail first before you go exploring;;;;
8732;-) );;;;
8733;#NAME?;;;;
8734;so you can rest at the 1st level;;;;
8735;it has a shaded picnic table and a great view of the city;;;;
8736;- at the top there's a huge platform with an amazing view of the city;;;;
8737;with a little bit of nevada history;;;;
8738;it's peaceful at the top;;;;
8739;and reminds me why i love nature and this city;;;;
8740;#NAME?;;;;
8741;either at the top of the mountain or in the park;;;;
8742;it's peaceful to watch;;;;
8743;- there's a small cement stage at the other end of the park;;;;
8744;i'm guessing for plays and performances during the warmer months;;;;
8745;#NAME?;;;;
8746;#NAME?;;;;
8747;*** tip;;;;
8748;if you don't live in mountain's edge & you're coming from i-15/blue diamond or 215/buffalo it's on buffalo road & you'll have to make a u-turn to get to the entrance of this park;;;;
8749;if you are looking for chinese acrobats as in other cirque du solei shows don't go to this show;;;;
8750;but if you love the fab 4 and a great visual show interpreting a variety of their songs- you have to see this show;;;;
8751;although our seats were good there didn't seem to be a bad seat in the house;;;;
8752;the costumes were amazing - a visual masterpiece and the sound was insane (just like the ticket prices!);;;;
8753;i especially love how they took sound bites of the beatles talking and incorporated it into the show;;;;
8754;oh how i wish i could have been brought up when music was really meaningful;;;;
8755;(sigh);;;;
8756;we have been trying eggplant sandwiches all over the valley because my day loves eggplant;;;;
8757;delfaco's sandwich on the italian hoagie had way way too much bread more bread than eggplant;;;;
8758;the eggplant by itself was very tasty but get it without so much bread you will thank me later;;;;
8759;we will be back to try something else;;;;
8760;i went at 11 am on a saturday morning and still waited over 30 minutes for a take out order;;;;
8761;it is a very crammed space a little italian deli in between a italian grocery store;;;;
8762;the prices for the italian pastas and cheese are a bit over priced;;;;
8763;the espresso is nicely priced at $1;;;;
8764;40 for a single shot;;;;
8765;i read some good reviews on this place and decided to give it a try;;;;
8766;i was not disappointed ! my son and i really liked the chicken fried steak;;;;
8767;you could tell it was handmade with cube steak and not a frozen patty;;;;
8768;the cinnamon roll was also homemade with good icing  not too sweat like cinnabon;;;;
8769;they also have preserves that are made by the owner  and the raspberry is out of this world;;;;
8770;i bought a small mason jar to take home;;;;
8771;the biscuits were fluffy  grits cooked just right  and eggs cooked perfectly could have used another one;;;;
8772;we will be coming back and looking forward to trying other things;;;;
8773;you have to be careful driving here because you will easily pass it as i did  and had to drive back around the block;;;;
8774;i recommend you come and the server was very nice;;;;
8775;all you need to know is dried and bland;;;;
8776;my burrito tasted like cardboard;;;;
8777;if you've placed cardboard in your mouth you know what i mean;;;;
8778;texture was similar too;;;;
8779;oh and they forgot my order;;;;
8780;i stood there for 10 mins then someone realized i didn't have my order;;;;
8781;omg longhitano's is absolutely disgusting! i've had more satisfactory meals from arby's than this over hyped pos;;;;
8782;our server was polite but a bit;;;;
8783;ditsy & didn't understand the questions we asked or reply with the correct response;;;;
8784;i ordered their alfredo- it smelled & looked terrible upon arrival but i forced myself to at least try it;;;;
8785;huge mistake! when i stabbed it with my fork it was one big massive clump that tasted like it was held together with elmers glue & watered down flour;;;;
8786;although it was luke warm @ best on the surface it was cold underneath;;;;
8787;even the poor attempt @ garlic bread was laughable;;;;
8788;someone smeared butter on toast & sprinkled too much  garlic salt on it;;;;
8789;it's pretty damn bad when olive garden's food is more tolerable than this inedible crap;;;;
8790;"our friend ordered their the biggest haja steak sandwich this should've been called ""the biggest hard turd sandwich"" if they wanted to provide a more accurate description";;;;
8791;when he bit into it he literally could not tear one piece off because it was so tough & rubbery;;;;
8792;he tried  sawing at it & the knife didn't even make a dent;;;;
8793;when mike stopped to ask us how everything was nate expressed how terrible the meat on the sandwich was @ mike stood their as if he didn't comprehend a word that was said to him;;;;
8794;"in fact he kept cutting nate off & saying "" so it's okay""";;;;
8795;"naturally nate was irritated & said "" no! i can't eat this"" & mike still didn't get it & kept talking over him";;;;
8796;then he walked away;;;;
8797;he never apologized nor offered to get nate something else to eat;;;;
8798;he didn't remove the cost from our bill nothing! when nate complained to our server he didn't understand either so the nasty sandwich sat there;;;;
8799;our server also saw that my pasta was left untouched but never asked if something was wrong;;;;
8800;i get this kid was clearly new to the food service industry but seriously -wtf!?!;;;;
8801;my husband had also ordered a drink from the bar when we first sat down it took our server over 15 minutes to grab it from the bar;;;;
8802;nate had requested a rootbeer not only did it take over 30 minutes but our server brought out a rootbeer float & charged us extra for the ice cream! normally i wouldn't suggest this but since the staff was ignoring our complaints the food wasn't even edible & our patience was gone;;;;
8803;i was tempted to leave without paying;;;;
8804;finally a seasoned waitress noticed our displeasure & offered to remove nates sandwich from our receipt;;;;
8805;however she only took 15% off of my alfredo & removed the charge for ice cream but charged us for 2 rootbeers when we only ordered 1;;;;
8806;"she then explained that all of their staff quit @ the same time & all the new hires are ""green""";;;;
8807;this is still unacceptable & i don't feel that anyone there is competent;;;;
8808;longhitano's is hands down the second worst meal i've had this year!;;;;
8809;yum! wasn't expecting this to be as good or as nice atmosphere wise;;;;
8810;with a name like nando's was comparing it to filly bees much better! homemade chips and salsa;;;;
8811;as a vegetarian i seriously appreciate the ability to order tacos burrito or chimichangas with veggies or potatoes! plus you can't beat pitchers of dos equis! i took off a star because their guacamole tastes like it comes from a package;;;;
8812;this place gets enough business to use real guacamole;;;;
8813;worth a taste if you're in the area!;;;;
8814;fu ck everything in the past;;;;
8815;this place is bomb omg tacos burgers tortas i'm typing with fill belly!!!;;;;
8816;#funtacoslv;;;;
8817;i can't say enough great things about my experience here this past weekend;;;;
8818;i had gone to a different location months back and left pretty unsatisfied as it seemed the number one goal of that location was just to try and sell me as much as possible;;;;
8819;when i let them know i was unsatisfied;;;;
8820;"it was ""well we will only charge half the cost for a full hair to lighten it more";;;;
8821;""" i had gone into get my dark brown hair ombrã© and realized that it may take a few sessions to get it as light as i wanted but when the staff didn't seem to care it turned me off";;;;
8822;needless to say i was scared to try and get my hair done again from this location so i searched yelp and found the location on windmill and pecos had some great reviews;;;;
8823;i called in the morning and was scheduled shortly after;;;;
8824;brittney was my hair stylist and i had told her about my previous experience;;;;
8825;she was shocked to hear about the last experience and assured me i would be happy;;;;
8826;during the whole process she was amazing;;;;
8827;explaining every step;;;;
8828;my hair went from literally a line of copper brownish-blonde  to beautifully dimensioned array of highlights and lowlights;;;;
8829;i was so happy by the end and can't wait to go back;;;;
8830;omg this place is amazing! the food was phenomenal but our server christina was by far the best part of the meal! she was so outgoing funny attentive and well informed on the menu;;;;
8831;will definitely be back for the food and christina;;;;
8832;i recently moved to aurora from texas and i always get my nails done every 2-3 weeks;;;;
8833;i walked in into this nail salon as it's near to where i'll be staying to talk to the people in there to explain to them how i get my nails done   and to see if i could make an appointment for the next day;;;;
8834;when i walked in no one acknowledged me;;;;
8835;a guy asked me to walk over to him to talk to him;;;;
8836;i thought that was rude because i personally wouldn't want anyone inquiring about their nails whilst i'm getting mine done;;;;
8837;he could have excused himself or told me to wait for a few minutes so he could talk to me;;;;
8838;"when i told him i had a picture and wanted to show him if what i wanted done was something he could do he rudely said ""well we have over 250 nail polishes you can see if we have those colors";;;;
8839;""" like really?";;;;
8840;"i then politely asked him if he could replicate the picture i had to which he rudely responded ""probably not"" no eye contact no regard of me whatsoever";;;;
8841;needles to say i walked out thinking how rude! i will never set foot in this establishment to spend my money in there;;;;
8842;very poor first impression;;;;
8843;extremely rude guy i spoke to;;;;
8844;first impressions are everything to me and to most customers;;;;
8845;don't go there unless if you want to be treated like a second class citizen;;;;
8846;i tried to treat myself for going to a four-star hotel but it seemed they were holding back on basic amenities and proper service unless you would buy into all the atrocious add-ons that they suggested;;;;
8847;no breakfast no wifi and when i got into my room all my lamps tv phone etc;;;;
8848;were either plugged off or on a timer so that they could save money on electricity;;;;
8849;i found this out because i wanted to call guest services to let them know the tv wasn't working and realized in short succession that the phones weren't working either;;;;
8850;that's not just an inconvenience it's a safety hazard!;;;;
8851;i had to ride the elevator and walk into the lobby with my slippers with people glancing at me;;;;
8852;i had to stay that way for a long time given that i could not find a single person to help me in that big hotel;;;;
8853;i ended up having to walk outside to the streets where i finally got a valet to go inside call a manager and waited out my final few minutes while she finally found some time for me;;;;
8854;four star hotel;;;;
8855;really? nice place clean sheets but unfortunately an unpleasant experience;;;;
8856;great location though;;;;
8857;found this place on yelp and we couldn't have agreed more with the reviews;;;;
8858;"this is a tiny hole in the wall next to an asian massage ""r&t""";;;;
8859;i could have driven by this place hundreds of times and never seen it;;;;
8860;ignore the tacky decor because this place has some of the best carne asada in phoenix;;;;
8861;start with the chips and salsa and you will see that this isn't your regular taco shop;;;;
8862;we tried the carne asada tacos carne asada burrito and the chips and guacamole;;;;
8863;all delicious;;;;
8864;the carne asada is tender and full of flavor;;;;
8865;guacamole and salsas are so fresh and tasty that you will run thru your chips in no time;;;;
8866;we have been to sonora grill now a few times and i am just getting around to my review;;;;
8867;i think that says it all;;;;
8868;sonora grill is a must!;;;;
8869;just moved to phoenix;;;;
8870;stopped at hinckley's for some much needed lighting and fan advice;;;;
8871;was not disappointed!  bridgett was incredibly knowledgeable helpful and friendly;;;;
8872;some of my current needs they could meet and for the others bridgett had great advice;;;;
8873;this will be my #1 stop for lighting for as long as i'm in phoenix;;;;
8874;and btw don't think that because they're specialists that they are more expensive;;;;
8875;prices are very competitive;;;;
8876;this is a very fun restaurant with amazing food;;;;
8877;i go to the other location just about every day and wanted to give this one a try so i did and was very pleased;;;;
8878;it feels like a different restaurant because of the size but it's the same great food and same fun vibe;;;;
8879;the staff is great and i will definitely be coming back on the regular to see them;;;;
8880;come in twice a week till you've tried the entire menu  i promise you'll be glad you did;;;;
8881;looking at the bad reviews i was kind of scared before getting the vehicle;;;;
8882;i thought i will keep it on hold to experience it and if something goes bad i would try at other rentals;;;;
8883;but the whole process was so smooth;;;;
8884;i booked it through costco car rentals so the rental was bit less and i got a decent rate for insurance;;;;
8885;reached at terminal-2 parked my personal vehicle and took the shuttle to the car rentals place;;;;
8886;reached budget at 9;;;;
8887;30am to pick up the vehicle there was one guy in the queue;;;;
8888;the rental guy was very friendly and he offered me 3 flavors of the jeep and he gave me the 2015 model;;;;
8889;the vehicle was in excellent condition and make sure you don't mess up with the vehicle while returning;;;;
8890;4 star because of few issues;;;;
8891;#NAME?;;;;
8892;- before i got the jeep someone had put chocolates inside the cabinet and the jeep manual was in lot of chocolate !!!! i wanted to know more about the 4w drive but looks like no one knew how to operate it;;;;
8893;i googled it  out and found my answers;;;;
8894;yes one lady came and cleaned the chocolates before i got my jeep;;;;
8895;yes i am  impressed about the whole process of budget sky harbor;;;;
8896;best fajita in town in my opinion! we have been there twice and the only thing we ordered was fajita for two with beef only;;;;
8897;it was always awesome and delicious;;;;
8898;staff was courteous there and the price was reasonable;;;;
8899;we aren't gonna go anywhere else for fajita from now on xd;;;;
8900;so this is where all the fabrics i have been looking for are kept! i stumbled on carol's fabric shop when i was working in the area and didn't have a lot to spend;;;;
8901;you can bet though that i am headed here on my own time;;;;
8902;i need more of this;;;;
8903;even though i live 250 miles away i've told others about it who are going to be in the area and check it out this weekend;;;;
8904;i love this place and can't wait until i can come back and really go shopping;;;;
8905;i recently moved to az and this was my first saturday night coming to hooters;;;;
8906;i came right after getting off of work to grab some wings and a beer before heading home for the evening;;;;
8907;i just wanted to say the staff was extremely friendly and fun;;;;
8908;i definitely enjoyed my visit and will be coming back;;;;
8909;brandi tending bar was great to talk to;;;;
8910;quick witted and funny;;;;
8911;food was great on time and delicious even though when i walked in there was a ufc fight going on and the place was packed;;;;
8912;their ability to get food and drinks out with a full house was refreshing;;;;
8913;i was skeptical at first but they nailed it;;;;
8914;i would recommend this location to anyone;;;;
8915;server was slow but you're at the airport food was decent ! but something happened after wth the server that was not very pleasant;;;;
8916;soooooo they only get 3 stars lol;;;;
8917;i have been fortune to spend around 20 weekends at the venetian including the first weekend they opened;;;;
8918;it has always been and still is a class hotel;;;;
8919;it has worn well and looks as good it did that first weekend;;;;
8920;the rooms are all suites and some are bigger then others but even in the smallest suite is larger then most hotels junior suite;;;;
8921;you know this hotel got it's act together when there version of a coffee shop is the grand lux cafe  which is a off shoot of the cheesecake factory;;;;
8922;they have great restaurants and shows;;;;
8923;the poker room is one of the best;;;;
8924;see you soon old friend;;;;
8925;we had been searching for a new place to get our maltese and yorkie groomed since we weren't satisfied with our current groomer;;;;
8926;i was a little nervous dropping them off but the ladies there are so nice and reassuring!;;;;
8927;we couldn't pick them up until the end of the day and they made sure that my dogs had time to play and run and werent in a cage all day;;;;
8928;their haircuts are exactly what we wanted them to be and they looked so cute! they smelled clean and looked so happy;;;;
8929;will definitely be coming back!;;;;
8930;large cirque du soleil souvenir shop with merchandise from mystere;;;;
8931;store is open even when no shows are going on;;;;
8932;less busy before the show starts;;;;
8933;"okay i know this is supposed to be the ""cheap"" restaurant in the wynn but we're still talking about $18 burgers for lunch so cheap is relative";;;;
8934;we waited 35 minutes for our food and of course they got our order wrong;;;;
8935;did i mention that the place is like half full;;;;
8936;good thing it wasn't busier then we might wait an hour for the wrong order;;;;
8937;they of course add 18% for parties of 6 or more so great!  i get to way overpay for the wrong food;;;;
8938;i got lazy and didn't want to leave the resort;;;;
8939;bad call there;;;;
8940;i love fry bread so i was very excited to try emerson fry bread;;;;
8941;i was not disappointed;;;;
8942;it's definitely not state fair fry bread;;;;
8943;the gentleman who took our order was lively and personable;;;;
8944;the time flies while you wait for your order because he's so entertaining!  i ordered the d$ (chicken & green chile);;;;
8945;it was actually no longer on the menu but they hooked it up;;;;
8946;and i'm glad they did because it was delicious!  the fry bread itself was perfect and wouldn't have changed one thing about any of the toppings;;;;
8947;the mixed greens were especially nice;;;;
8948;definitely an upgrade from the tasteless iceburg that most places serve;;;;
8949;i will absolutely eat here again;;;;
8950;i have to try the steak!;;;;
8951;bad staff;;;;
8952;staff was not welcoming at all;;;;
8953;i checked in online for my two boys and within 5 mins we were at great clips;;;;
8954;on screen we were shown the first to get haircut  however they took other in;;;;
8955;when i asked why is that -staff with raised voice this is how it works and you r next -i waited for next one and again they repeated same taking other in before us;;;;
8956;with raised tone and bad;;;;
8957;i left with my 2boys from there without getting haircut;;;;
8958;will not go again;;;;
8959;bad bad staff;;;;
8960;they do not have a curtesy to talk to a customer;;;;
8961;worst staff;;;;
8962;wow! this this is the best burger in town;;;;
8963;and i've had a lot of burgers! service was friendly and fast!;;;;
8964;when there are so many other choices why shop from a place that has zero customer service and follow up;;;;
8965;this company is run by an absolute a*****e;;;;
8966;"they sold me a ""kamado rocket"" which is a beautiful piece of art but does not work due to terrible metal work and they have no intention of fixing their $3,000 pos";;;;
8967;do not i repeat do not do business with this company;;;;
8968;they say they are open until 7pm;;;;
8969;it's is 615pm and the guy inside says they are closed;;;;
8970;won't be wasting my gas to come here again;;;;
8971;they close early!;;;;
8972;i have been here countless times and keep coming back;;;;
8973;all of my friends are hooked too;;;;
8974;delicious salads bowls burgers wraps and desserts--all vegan! best items include black bean burrito buddha bowl ace of kales salad quinoa onion rings sweet potato fries and the vanilla cupcake;;;;
8975;always busy but totally worth it;;;;
8976;i've had the pleasure of dining at the other locations of yardbird so i was pretty excited to be able to try out their new vegas location;;;;
8977;i like it although it definitely departs from the southern draw of the other location and that authentic kitchen to table feel;;;;
8978;we got the usual deviled eggs chicken and waffles and cobbler to finish;;;;
8979;overall the chicken was not as great as the miami location and the cobbler was a bit disappointing;;;;
8980;however the eggs were delicious and waffles were on point!;;;;
8981;i will say it's a pretty solid lunch spot so definitely pay a visit when you have a chance;;;;
8982;soooo delicious! with all the burger joints in town this one is in my top three favorites now! we ate spicy burger and dog the burger was juicy and flavorful the dog spicy and different;;;;
8983;it is worth the 30 minute trip for us to get there;;;;
8984;a cute little place with games great service and is clean;;;;
8985;was able to get in for 2 pedicures late on a friday evening;;;;
8986;no rushing no short cuts very attentive and finished both our services even after closing time;;;;
8987;my husband was very happy with his much-needed pedicure;;;;
8988;i also got a gel mani and my nails are gorgeous;;;;
8989;thank you to kimberly for doing an excellent job;;;;
8990;other places will file and file and file your nails down until they are paper thin and practically peeling;;;;
8991;but kimberly kept my natural nails intact;;;;
8992;i absolutely love my easter nails! we will definitely return;;;;
8993;i want this place to do well because it would be great to have a fancy mexican option in town;;;;
8994;i think they could make this into a pretty solid little restaurant if they fix some problems;;;;
8995;the drinks are tasty but very very heavy on the ice;;;;
8996;they are charging drink prices comparable to boltini down the street which actually gives you a full glass instead of all this padding;;;;
8997;we felt a bit ripped off;;;;
8998;i also wish that the specialty cocktail selection had some not-sweet cocktails;;;;
8999;one of us got a taco plate and the other got a torta plate;;;;
9000;on both the sides left a lot to be desired;;;;
9001;i'm pretty sure our beans and rice were out of a can and the potato wedges were fresh out of the freezer;;;;
9002;the tacos themselves (1 shrimp 1 fish) were pretty good though! only complaint is that they didn't double up on the tortillas so one of mine fell apart a bit;;;;
9003;the steak torta was pretty good although it would have done well with some pickled chiles;;;;
9004;i am somewhat annoyed that they don't provide free chips with dinner;;;;
9005;the entree size isn't that big which would have been fine if we got chips but we left feeling hungry;;;;
9006;another rather big oversight is not providing some sort of spicy table salsa;;;;
9007;the food wasn't very spicy in itself;;;;
9008;any good mexican restaurant should have some house salsas;;;;
9009;i think the main problem here is cutting corners in really obvious ways;;;;
9010;drinks loaded to brim with ice no chips no table salsa sides are low quality afterthoughts;;;;
9011;even the lack of the doubled up tortilla;;;;
9012;come on guys tortillas are not expensive;;;;
9013;you can afford to give me 4 instead of 2 with my $8 entree;;;;
9014;another weird thing that was noted by all my dining companions;;;;
9015;pretty much every mexican joint in the town has mexican people working the back and the front of the house including several restaurants owned by this very same family;;;;
9016;here the front of house waitstaff is exclusively white skinny blond ladies;;;;
9017;that has to be a conscious decision;;;;
9018;"i can't help but throw at least some side eye at an establishment that decided that actual mexican people aren't ""classy"" enough to wait tables";;;;
9019;let me start by saying i wish that i could give 1/2 stars;;;;
9020;i would rate 3 1/2 vs 3;;;;
9021;really better than ok but i'm not sure that it rates 4 stars;;;;
9022;it was a good restaurant but had some pretty big negatives;;;;
9023;the first thing that i notice was how large the restaurant was;;;;
9024;it seemed to go on forever;;;;
9025;which was amazing considering how quickly our food came out;;;;
9026;they have an open kitchen so you can see how many people they have working in the kitchen;;;;
9027;needless to say it's busy;;;;
9028;one drawback as others have mentioned is the noise level;;;;
9029;fortunately my husband and i were sitting by drapery panels so the 2 of us could carry on a conversation;;;;
9030;others sitting more towards the inside of the restaurant would have a difficult time hearing each other;;;;
9031;another issue is that it is pretty dark;;;;
9032;i understand ambiance but this was a little too much;;;;
9033;they know this so they do compensate and make the print larger on the menu;;;;
9034;when it came to eating and my food was the same color (fish and cauliflower) it was hard to tell exactly what i was putting on the fork;;;;
9035;our server was very good;;;;
9036;attentive and full of information when clarification was needed for the menu;;;;
9037;we had avocado bruschetta which was just okay;;;;
9038;i should of skipped it;;;;
9039;i ordered the pacific sea bass;;;;
9040;the fish was good and so was the cauliflower;;;;
9041;they only thing i didn't care for was the preserved grapefruit;;;;
9042;the funny thing is that while eating it i said to my husband that i didn't like the orange flavor that i was sometimes getting on the fish;;;;
9043;it was either orange or when they preserve it then it totally changes the taste profile from grapefruit to orange;;;;
9044;my husband had the lasagna bolognese;;;;
9045;he was happy with his choice;;;;
9046;overall a good restaurant;;;;
9047;i took off since it was extremely dark and loud;;;;
9048;also the food comes out almost too quick if you just want to sit and talk;;;;
9049;the food was good especially for the price not excellent;;;;
9050;was absolutely starving we passed this place and decided to give it a try;;;;
9051;prices are decent fries are fresh cut and amazing burger was fresh and flavorful;;;;
9052;i would get take our next time because the place was freezing imnot sure they had heat on not the most enjoyable eating lunch with a jacket scarf and hat on;;;;
9053;i have stayed in so many hotels in vegas and by far for the money you will not find a better hotel room for $220 on a saturday night;;;;
9054;this room was a one bedroom with two flat screens a 19inch tv in the restroom a mini bar a restroom big enough for 20 people shower and deep tub and  even a second restroom;;;;
9055;you could have your own party here and could sleep 4-5 if you had to;;;;
9056;its always a speedy check in and out even when there is a line with 15-20 people;;;;
9057;this is the only room i have stayed in for under $250 per night and i actually felt like i was in a fancy upscale suite;;;;
9058;these are really cool rooms;;;;
9059;what a shock!;;;;
9060;had philly cheese steaks coast to coast including philly;;;;
9061;in 55 years of enjoying sandwiches;;;;
9062;this gilbert geno's has the distintion of being one of the worst sandwiches i have had;;;;
9063;i got a large on an ok bread with a small serving mix of goo that reminded me of manwich out of a can;;;;
9064;or cincinnati chili;;;;
9065;either way putting the geno's name on it would make joey vento roll in his grave;;;;
9066;i was not a fan of this location or the staff;;;;
9067;the food was sub par the service was lacking and overall it was not a good experience;;;;
9068;for the amount of $$ per dish i expect it to be prepared better;;;;
9069;i was staying across the street at the wynn and my post-disneyland half marathon legs weren't really up for a lot of walking so i suggested we check out ti for dinner;;;;
9070;i think the buffet at treasure island used to be called dishes or something and i remembered it being pretty good;;;;
9071;"unfortunately ""the buffet"" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality";;;;
9072;first all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy;;;;
9073;the slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey;;;;
9074;the turkey fared a little better but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty;;;;
9075;speaking of salty i was curious to try the pho which was you guessed it super salty;;;;
9076;there is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter;;;;
9077;and finally the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup;;;;
9078;on the plus side the crab legs weren't bad and i enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries;;;;
9079;i hope this buffet gets their act together soon;;;;
9080;sightly unrelated but this was my first time at ti in a long time and i couldn't stand the smell of the casino! they pump some weird coconut sunblock smell all over the place which is way worse than stale cigarette air;;;;
9081;yuck;;;;
9082;twice now they've let me down at the islington store;;;;
9083;i ordered parts that they said they would send from the queen street store and to come in the next day;;;;
9084;i arrive and the parts are missing or they've made an error and they never had them;;;;
9085;no apologies;;;;
9086;i drove quite a distance to this store;;;;
9087;that was the last time;;;;
9088;they are a confused bunch at the new islington store;;;;
9089;lots of other places to find tools;;;;
9090;had the lemon grass chicken;;;;
9091;it was amazing;;;;
9092;the ambience is great ! i highly recommend this if your looking for good vietnamese;;;;
9093;a solid 3;;;;
9094;5 based on the chicken sandwich;;;;
9095;i cannot speak about the pizza or pasta but this sandwich shop is in a really convenient location for me;;;;
9096;i stopped in 'cause i was pressed for time had to grab a quick dinner & didn't want subway/mcd's in the plaza;;;;
9097;i asked the girl taking the orders about which was better either the panzarotti or 1 of the sanwiches;;;;
9098;she answered sandwiches and suggested the chicken;;;;
9099;chicken was in a schnitzel format flattened breaded & deep fried - actually quite similar to a veal sandwich!;;;;
9100;only 1 size of sandwich here and they were quite substantial cut in half in which i only ate half for dinner all for $7;;;;
9101;cheaper than on-a-bun;;;;
9102;a slew of toppings (cheese mushrooms peppers etc;;;;
9103;) were all included for an additional $1;;;;
9104;not bad if you feel as though you need these additional things;;;;
9105;hot green peppers were added as i wanted it spicy;;;;
9106;very good especially when it's eaten fresh!;;;;
9107;no nonsense sandwich place hopefully healthier than mcd's??;;;;
9108;always a good time at this place! you can't beat the live music great drinks and over all good energy! the fishbowl is a must when you get there it's by far the best bang for your bucket! i would recommend this place to any and everyone!;;;;
9109;pretty stinky service today;;;;
9110;although the food is usually good bar food we didn't get to place our order today;;;;
9111;no less than 5 servers passed our table while we waited to place our order;;;;
9112;maybe we just caught them in the middle of a shift change;;;;
9113;ended up leaving but not too upset as we went to taste of buffalo where their wing are just better;;;;
9114;this was soooo good ! the fish was delicious;;;;
9115;make sure you give them your total rewards card for more points;;;;
9116;everything taste really good;;;;
9117;if you're platinum and up you're drinks are included (alcoholic) but you might as well grab drinks off the casino floor;;;;
9118;the ice cream is made in house it's not soft serve;;;;
9119;there are comfortable booths and tv screens in there;;;;
9120;the bathrooms are located outside;;;;
9121;ask for directions;;;;
9122;it was good;;;;
9123;for the 3 of us it was $81 just to give you an idea;;;;
9124;i was too busy stuffing my face to take photos;;;;
9125;sorry !;;;;
9126;honestly i just don't get the how everyone is so in love with this place?  i'm not a native so when i moved to the area many years ago everyone advised my family that we absolutely had to try a burnt almond torte from prantl's;;;;
9127;we did and to be fair that is a great dessert;;;;
9128;however i have worked across the street from them for a decade now and the office ladies i work with have brought in nearly everything they sell at prantl's over the last decade;;;;
9129;the cookies the cupcakes the junior pastries danishes donuts etc;;;;
9130;have all made there way into our office and i have never been wowed by any of them;;;;
9131;in fact i find most items to be pretty sub par;;;;
9132;i think if prantl's wasn't a true bakery and merely a shop that produced one signature cake it would probably deserve five stars but that's not the case and since i have to judge on the totality of their products as a bakery not only the burnt almond torte which is their claim to fame and recognition i find them to be quite lackluster overall;;;;
9133;if you want a true bakery treat i would suggest  la gourmandine for anything vanilla for cupcakes jean marc chatellier even the somewhat overrated oakmont bakery as other than the burnt almond torte you are paying specialty bakery prices but getting giant eagle quality which is fine but at that point you might as well go to giant eagle and pay accordingly;;;;
9134;i had lunch at the buffet and it was by far the best buffet i've had in vegas to date (i've travelled here quite often);;;;
9135;the choices at lunch time are a bit overwhelming as they had full breakfast choices with omlette station sushi bar meat carving station pastas deserts and the list goes on and on;;;;
9136;my only dissappointment was that i could not eat more;;;;
9137;best $20 buffet/variety you can have on the strip;;;;
9138;this place is so awesome! the food is so good i haven't had crepes this good in years! people are friendly and they have a good barista along with a ton of different drinks;;;;
9139;only down side is they are only open until 2;;;;
9140;we were looking for lancasters and ended up here;;;;
9141;which was good bc the food was pretty good!;;;;
9142;i had the philly with onion and mushroom and white american cheese and the homemade chips and it was all delicious;;;;
9143;the sandwich had a lot of flavor without being really greasy (as cheesesteaks often are) and the chips were a good mix of crispy and soft that i expect when i'm getting homemade chips;;;;
9144;other dishes at the table - chicken club sandwich (reportedly very good) and a cheeseburger (reported as ok but he ate it all so it couldnt have been too bad!!);;;;
9145;note;;;;
9146;they had the best sweet tea i've had in a few years;;;;
9147;really super delish;;;;
9148;i'd definetely go back here;;;;
9149;the last time i gave this place a try the food sucked and i gave it 2 stars;;;;
9150;on a recent vegas trip my flight was at a gate nearby and i decided to give them another chance;;;;
9151;this time around the food still sucked but the employees are even worse;;;;
9152;here's what happened;;;;
9153;i ordered the following items;;;;
9154;bean rice cheese burrito $6;;;;
9155;bottle of diet pepsi $3;;;;
9156;since i had a backpack and other stuff in my hand i forgot the bottle of diet pepsi at the counter after i paid for the meal;;;;
9157;i went to the counter to get settled in a spot to eat and get napkins utensils etc;;;;
9158;5 minutes later they called my number for my burrito;;;;
9159;i was starving so i started to eat it;;;;
9160;after a few bites i noticed that i didn't have my soda;;;;
9161;where was it?  i looked around went back to the counter;;;;
9162;the employees looked at me but didn't say anything;;;;
9163;i walked around again looking for it;;;;
9164;"then i said to the girl cashier ""i think i left my soda somewhere have you seen it?""  she said ""no"" then looked at one of the guys and said something in spanish to him";;;;
9165;"he said ""oh i think i have it";;;;
9166;"i found it on the counter""";;;;
9167;i watched as he reached into his backpack and gave it back to me;;;;
9168;wtf?!  i think they do this all the time watch for people to leave stuff behind and then take it;;;;
9169;the appalling thing is that i was still in the restaurant!;;;;
9170;i didn't say anything to them;;;;
9171;it would've done no good anyway;;;;
9172;once a thief always a thief;;;;
9173;that does it for me i will never eat here again;;;;
9174;return factor - 0%;;;;
9175;came here for brunch with friends for the downtown tempe brunch crawl and it was very crowded;;;;
9176;i don't think the food was anything too special;;;;
9177;service;;;;
9178;slow;;;;
9179;in their defense the place was pretty packed but all the dishes came out at separate times;;;;
9180;ambience;;;;
9181;indoor and outdoor seating though be careful with outdoors because it is hot in the summer and very few shaded areas;;;;
9182;food;;;;
9183;for the brunch crawl there were $3 bloody mary's $3 bloody maria's and $3 breakfast tacos;;;;
9184;we got an assortment;;;;
9185;the food was good but nothing huge to write home over and the tacos were tasty but nothing too special;;;;
9186;this shop combines coffee breakfast and coffee break items and a yarn shop (which made my wife happy);;;;
9187;during a recent visit we enjoyed well made asparagus and ham quiches with well dressed side greens;;;;
9188;there were three regular and one decaf offerings from two area roasters;;;;
9189;service was friendly and helpful;;;;
9190;they had great food try the santafe skillet delicious;;;;
9191;but they have a tremendous waiter named david;;;;
9192;this gentleman belongs in a 5 star restaurant with out a doubt he made the evening for me and my family;;;;
9193;the night shift wow what service;;;;
9194;just go one time you will walk out with a smile dennys is really lucky to have this guy;;;;
9195;) wgag a great pleasure thank you david!!;;;;
9196;and having been back again a few days ago i will leave my rating as 3-stars;;;;
9197;the service was faster this time and the food was okay but i really don't find anything special about it;;;;
9198;i had a bowl of the witch's brew chowder which was pretty good and the coleslaw that i missed the first time;;;;
9199;overall i would say that the food is on par with other places that i have had fish and chips although a little more expensive than some;;;;
9200;i might return if in the area but wouldn't travel across town just to go back;;;;
9201;i have been here way too many times and we are over it;;;;
9202;i will say prices are good on both food and drinks but you get what you pay for;;;;
9203;on two occasions we had large parties (15+) who all are and drank a lot and we had horrible service;;;;
9204;they acted like w were a bother when actually we probably spent close to $800 that night in total;;;;
9205;very disappointing;;;;
9206;we will not be back;;;;
9207;ended up there for beer week;;;;
9208;atmosphere is great although pretty loud;;;;
9209;had the calamari octopus and wings appetizers;;;;
9210;first two were really good bites though small portions;;;;
9211;wings were spicy but not special;;;;
9212;looking forward to them opening up the butcher shop;;;;
9213;boarder grill has pretty good food but i've had just ok meals there too;;;;
9214;considering the prices i'd expect every meal to be exceptional but i haven't been blown away every time;;;;
9215;it's a special place for the wife and i so we do enjoy going;;;;
9216;the drinks are pretty amazing and i leave stuffed every time;;;;
9217;i suggest anything with steak in it and you can't go wrong;;;;
9218;not a fan of red meat? go for the carnitas;;;;
9219;i was still too full from lunch at the coffee cup in boulder city to eat a whole dinner;;;;
9220;i had the white sangria excellent;;;;
9221;also the salad with the asian pear and blue cheese crumbles;;;;
9222;the dressing was mango and delicious;;;;
9223;but the best part were the desserts;;;;
9224;we had the pineapple upside down cake w;;;;
9225;coconut ice cream and the chocolate molten cake with raspberry coulis and vanilla ice cream;;;;
9226;wow! both were just awesome;;;;
9227;we don't have anything comparable to the pineapple upside down cake in boston it was fantastic;;;;
9228;service was excellent!;;;;
9229;i have never had such lagging and unprofessional contact w a rental company;;;;
9230;the contracts are illegal and not beneficial to anyone but them;;;;
9231;i would get a lawyer involved when dealing w either constance or eric;;;;
9232;not so good;;;;
9233;extremely slow service;;;;
9234;chicken not very tasty;;;;
9235;instant mashed potatoes;;;;
9236;gravy no flavor;;;;
9237;as we were eating there were 15 people waiting in line for service;;;;
9238;pretty expensive for what you get;;;;
9239;we wont be back;;;;
9240;this place gives buffets a good name;;;;
9241;the food is always fresh and interesting;;;;
9242;the breakfast and brunch are possibly the best in las vegas;;;;
9243;the friday and saturday night gourmet dinner buffet is unreal;;;;
9244;try beef wellington venison and steak tartar just to name a few;;;;
9245;we were searching for a local peruvian restaurant and found this place on yelp;;;;
9246;it was the midafternoon so the atmosphere was subdued;;;;
9247;"some may refer to this place as a ""hole in the wall,"" but the antiquated interior was much more conducive for large groups than their former location not too far away";;;;
9248;during our visit the green-colored dã©cor included a large mural blue-checkered floors tvs and three rows of tables stretched across the dining area;;;;
9249;santi and i started with the ceviche de pescado ($12;;;;
9250;95) that came with slices of tilapia stacked and marinated in lime juice spices lettuce yam red onions and peruvian corn;;;;
9251;the tilapia was fresh nicely seasoned with lime juice without it being too overpowering;;;;
9252;the spices were nicely embedded and accompanied well when eaten with the sharp onions and sweet lettuce;;;;
9253;the peruvian corn and yam were delicious too;;;;
9254;at first i was concerned about the portion size but the fish turned out plentiful and worthwhile;;;;
9255;we then shared pollo saltado ($11;;;;
9256;95) made with chunks of chicken sautã©ed with chopped tomatoes french fries red onions cilantro mignonette and soy sauce and a side of steamed rice;;;;
9257;the profile of the sauce was on point to bolster the flavors of the chicken;;;;
9258;the red onions and tomatoes also nicely contributed to the profile of this dish;;;;
9259;the fries were tasty fried to perfection and i was glad the cuts were on the thicker side to soak up the sweet-savory flavors;;;;
9260;i only wished the fries were cooked down a little more with the onions and tomatoes;;;;
9261;it met my expectations;;;;
9262;the seco de res ($13;;;;
9263;95) was made with stewed beef loin in cilantro sauce green peas and served with fried yucca salsa criolla and peruano beans;;;;
9264;the beef was very nicely seasoned with wine and other spices;;;;
9265;it was nicely stewed tender but also had lots of dry spots;;;;
9266;the use of green peas gave a nice sweet dimension to this dish;;;;
9267;the salsa criolla and fried yucca also have some textures and sharp bites to the refined beef loins;;;;
9268;we both loved the peruano beans;;;;
9269;it was nicely cooked down subtly sweet and flavorful;;;;
9270;we were also given a side of roasted peruvian corn with aji sauce;;;;
9271;the sauce appeared more like a chunky salsa than the creamy smooth type i usually find in restaurants;;;;
9272;the flavors were far-reaching but there were a number of limitations worth noting;;;;
9273;first unlike most peruvian restaurants tumi does not offer fresh bread as a starter for the meal;;;;
9274;secondly service was friendly and courteous throughout the meal;;;;
9275;but for whatever reason the server personally wrote the tip into our bill before delivery it to our table an act i find unusual offensive and disrespectful;;;;
9276;ironically we were going to give her a bigger tip until this happened;;;;
9277;the server did however give us two coupons for $10 off each time we return to order at least $15 worth of food;;;;
9278;given the nice gesture i was willing to give her some benefit of the doubt but it still negatively influenced my rating of the experience;;;;
9279;interested diners should know that yelp currently has a $10 for $20 deal at one voucher per table;;;;
9280;i would be interested in returning to try their anticuchos ceviche de mixto cau cau aji de gallina and chaufa de camaron;;;;
9281;great spot for a quick coffee latte cap and of course japanese style cold brew;;;;
9282;good selection of pastries and snacks;;;;
9283;right in the heart of downtown phx they even have a lovely patio to enjoy your morning starter;;;;
9284;love this little liquor store;;;;
9285;close to the house;;;;
9286;excellent customer service and i love that its a family owned small business;;;;
9287;i come here about 3-4 times a week average (bc i have a drinking problem;;;;
9288;haha) i just never check in bc i forget;;;;
9289;so far they usually have the stuff i need;;;;
9290;lots of wine beer vodka  mixers;;;;
9291;you name it;;;;
9292;if they dont have something just ask;;;;
9293;my brother in law wanted a certain beer which they didnt have and the owner specially ordered it for him;;;;
9294;and now he always has his beer in stock;;;;
9295;this owner really cares about keeping his customers happy;;;;
9296;which keeps us loyal! enjoy!;;;;
9297;got here around 1;;;;
9298;45 waited in line for about 15 not bad;;;;
9299;bad happens now;;;;
9300;the placed jam packed and i cannot locate my friends for over half an hour;;;;
9301;they were playing pretty good music too bad i couldn't enjoy myself because i was on a mission to find my friends;;;;
9302;i find my friends one of them is drunk super drunk;;;;
9303;within five minutes of meeting them one of them pukes and next thing i know is we are being forced to leave;;;;
9304;did i mention i had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  but that was just my luck i can't blame the venue for things like this;;;;
9305;would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no;;;;
9306;sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry but absolutely no flexibility?  especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends);;;;
9307;it's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check meaning we had to take other people's belongings too);;;;
9308;you are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff);;;;
9309;i was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two;;;;
9310;the security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up;;;;
9311;i was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay;;;;
9312;we got the okay to go and i took the friend up to the room;;;;
9313;i get back to the beach club and explained i had my other friends' stuff and the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel;;;;
9314;i cannot reach the other friend with a phone;;;;
9315;shoot i'm thinking i'm not coming to vegas again;;;;
9316;one of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was how wonderful he asked! because i also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in;;;;
9317;see?  there is the reasonable flexibility;;;;
9318;(hence two stars not one);;;;
9319;so here is my real experience at encore beach club;;;;
9320;there is just too many people;;;;
9321;you are just standing in water jumping up and down or doing the same thing outside the pool;;;;
9322;it is too packed;;;;
9323;getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane;;;;
9324;with that many drunk people still drinking who knows how much pee is present in the water???;;;;
9325;the lifeguards are annoying as hell blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing etc;;;;
9326;they all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second i thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off;;;;
9327;if you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent dslr go for the tables and cabanas with wait service;;;;
9328;otherwise not worth the entrance fee;;;;
9329;by entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place) go here without the $$$$$;;;;
9330;standard party goers in vegas but this place by far the worst;;;;
9331;lock box is available for $20 by the entrance;;;;
9332;not going back;;;;
9333;buyer beware!!! if you buy a car from this place;;;;
9334;they sell it to you as is;;;;
9335;meaning they don't inspect the vehichles for mechanical issues;;;;
9336;my girlfriend purchased a car 3 weeks ago ned's new tires oil pan is stripped out and leaking oil cv boot is ripped cam seals are leaking;;;;
9337;they gave her a 1 month warranty from edmonds that was completely worthless the denied her claim;;;;
9338;she drove the car back to cali and has had issues ever since;;;;
9339;i have only been here a few times now but it is the closest bowling alley to my home and i have kids so there you go;;;;
9340;i never had a problem here and my kids like bowling and the game zone which all cost me a pretty penny but this is a business;;;;
9341;soda here is almost as much as the movie theater and the food isn't all that good but that is not why you come here;;;;
9342;i will go back when the kids ask and i am grateful to have a nice clean location for bowling near my home;;;;
9343;awesome place;;;;
9344;clubhouse salad is my favorite;;;;
9345;only place that i know of where the chicken is warm;;;;
9346;what a nice touch;;;;
9347;nice size serving;;;;
9348;like that they put a pitcher of iced tea on the table;;;;
9349;keep up the great work!;;;;
9350;one word;;;;
9351;amazing!!  real southern food - will not disappoint;;;;
9352;and i know southern!  chef austin took great care of our group for my bday celebration in vegas;;;;
9353;not easy to please everyone at a large table of picky eaters looking for a taste of home!  fried chicken was perfection - seasoned so well!  can't wait to return;;;;
9354;horrible service;;;;
9355;they took the orders of people who came in after me;;;;
9356;then they served people who ordered after me;;;;
9357;i felt like they ignored me because i was on my own;;;;
9358;i waited for over 30 minuted then they said the kitchen messed up;;;;
9359;if you are going to keep your customers happy  hire more staff that know what they are doing;;;;
9360;average food and service;;;;
9361;kind of dirty and some flies going around;;;;
9362;was ignored by two staff members when i walked up to ask a question;;;;
9363;plastic cups bowls and chopsticks;;;;
9364;great bbq!!!  truly like that i grew up on in alabama and georgia!  the variety and quality of the sides add to the experience all the more;;;;
9365;i just wish they had the amazing peach cobbler everytime i visit!  it's as close to grandma's as your going to get!;;;;
9366;we were there in the morning on a saturday the line for the place stretched around it and back to the elevators;;;;
9367;clearly 45 minutes;;;;
9368;this is sort of a fast food situation not a sit down restaurant and by that i mean you buy the food and fight for a place to eat at a very few seating options;;;;
9369;i'm sure the food is good based on these reviews but don't make a special trip to go here if you are in the area like we did;;;;
9370;we ended up going somewhere else;;;;
9371;no eggsluttiness for us unfortunately;;;;
9372;i have gone to this place for years and will go back but never to jen;;;;
9373;lets just say i had an eyebrow disaster;;;;
9374;i will never tint again here;;;;
9375;i asked for a light brown and i looked like bert and ernie;;;;
9376;awful and right before engagement photos;;;;
9377;we went because of the high recommendations;;;;
9378;i wish we would have walked out as soon as we saw the tacky decor;;;;
9379;each meal is large enough to feed an entire family if that family wants a low quality meal;;;;
9380;they definitively stress quantity over quality;;;;
9381;i suggest passing on this one;;;;
9382;we just returned here for our second visit on new year's eve (our first visit was a nye a few years back) and i'm just as in love with the place as i was before;;;;
9383;sure it's a splurge (which is why we only end up here on new year's eve) but it's a worthy splurge;;;;
9384;this nye they had a prix fixe menu in addition to a smaller-than-normal regular menu but since we are samplers we decided to each get the 5-course prix fixe so we could try as many things as possible;;;;
9385;i love that a trip to sonoma grille is not just dinner it's an entire event;;;;
9386;our waitress barb was fantastic - knowledgeable about the menu and passionate about it too;;;;
9387;they had just introduced some new items so the servers had recently done their menu taste-test and to hear her describe everything was like being there in the room as each dish was sampled and explained;;;;
9388;sonoma grille is regularly recognized as having one of the best wine selections in the city and it's true;;;;
9389;the markup is a bit much but again you're paying for atmosphere and experience in addition to good california wines (i'd love to see a bit more central coast as that's my favorite wine region but the name is 'sonoma,' so i give them a pass);;;;
9390;the staff can answer any question you have about the wine which i really appreciate;;;;
9391;we started with the 'trio of amuse' appetizer which had a parsnip bisque (light and flavorful) some oysters (which weird me out a bit i must admit) and a teeny tiny beef carpaccio that was perfect in every way;;;;
9392;it was just one little nibble but it was an insane burst of flavor;;;;
9393;while we were enjoying our wine and appetizer the bread server came around with a selection of four different kinds of bread;;;;
9394;instead of an individual table serving being brought to your table a server comes with a large basket and serves you a few pieces of your choosing plus olive oil for dipping;;;;
9395;i don't know why but i love this little unique aspect of this restaurant;;;;
9396;for the larger appetizer (oh yes two appetizers) we each got the jumbo lump crab and avocado plate;;;;
9397;this was gigantic - we could have easily split one between the two of us;;;;
9398;the crab pieces were huge easily the size of garlic bulbs;;;;
9399;my only suggestion for this would be to have a few pieces of the crostini instead of just a little sliver at the bottom;;;;
9400;the actual plate was quite juicy and the crunch of the crostini was a good balance;;;;
9401;mmm this was like crab guacamole so in other words amazing;;;;
9402;my husband and i each got different salads;;;;
9403;he opted for the fois gras salad (which he loved even though i was a bit too squeamish to sample it) and i got what i shall refer to as the pile 'o beets;;;;
9404;anyone who knows me knows my love affair with beets and this was just perfect;;;;
9405;slices of beets interspersed with goat cheese and well-seasoned;;;;
9406;wish i could eat that every day;;;;
9407;not very 'salad-y' but heavenly nonetheless;;;;
9408;there were five different options for entrees but we both had our eye on only one thing;;;;
9409;the filet mignon;;;;
9410;word;;;;
9411;this steak was cooked to perfection - so tender and juicy that my mouth is watering just remembering it!  it came with garlicky whipped potatoes and broccolini (which i delicately pushed to the side - sorry broccoli we're never going to be friends);;;;
9412;the portion was huge and i had the second half wrapped up for lunch the next day;;;;
9413;we were nearly too full for dessert but had to make room to try the chocolate ravioli;;;;
9414;it's a little weird and the texture is a bit chewier than i would have thought but the flavor was excellent;;;;
9415;it came with a nice blend of raspberry and vanilla sauce for dipping and was perfect alongside a steaming cup of coffee;;;;
9416;all in all we had another excellent experience;;;;
9417;barb even offered to keep my leftovers in the fridge until after the midnight festivities but i was afraid i'd forget in the massive crowd leaving downtown so we walked it back to the car anyway;;;;
9418;i was not going to let myself miss out on a second meal of that filet in the aftermath of pittsburgh fireworks lol;;;;
9419;this is one nye tradition we plan on keeping for many years to come!;;;;
9420;by far the best mexican food we have had in las vegas;;;;
9421;the fideo soup was loaded with flavor and so we're the salsas;;;;
9422;we ordered the lunch combinations so we could try a variety and we were not disappointed by any of them;;;;
9423;the service was impeccable we will definitely be back soon;;;;
9424;pretty unique place! the food was awesome and i met o;;;;
9425;simpson in the order line! haha! true story;;;;
9426;first the good things;;;;
9427;the chili chicken is awesome;;;;
9428;my wife and i both love it as it is spiced well and different than what we have had at other restaurants;;;;
9429;the nan was also fluffy and not greasy;;;;
9430;the peas palau was also unique with fruit and nuts;;;;
9431;now the challenges;;;;
9432;i have been here several times and although they say dosa on the online  menu and also on some signs in the restaurant i have yet to be there when they can actually serve it;;;;
9433;the beans in the chana masala were undercooked both times we ordered it;;;;
9434;they also don't make dall;;;;
9435;what indian restaurant doesn't make dal?  still too early to give them 2 stars but hope they get consistent on what they can serve;;;;
9436;i set up an appointment the night before and came in at 1pm on a saturday;;;;
9437;there was no wait;;;;
9438;charlie did my full set and his work looks great and he worked so diligently;;;;
9439;i definitely will be coming here from now on;;;;
9440;i get mani/pedis waxing and lashes;;;;
9441;the technicians are professional and friendly;;;;
9442;the salon is clean and trendy;;;;
9443;if it wasn't for the receptionists at the front desk;;;;
9444;(or should back desk) i may have given a 5 star review;;;;
9445;i have to say that i've never encountered such a rude unfriendly caustic group of women;;;;
9446;i've been told that this is a common complaint and that the owner knows but doesn't care;;;;
9447;honestly you can't go wrong;;;;
9448;the quality is consistent across all the chains and reliable to whatever you may be used to;;;;
9449;i do have one tip to customers;;;;
9450;i made an online order with the steak meat on the side;;;;
9451;never order the meat on the side;;;;
9452;i'm pregnant so i can't have raw meat but i love chipotle;;;;
9453;i didn't want to be a pain so i figured i'd just order it on the side and cook it to well done at home;;;;
9454;i only got a tiny little plastic tub of meat;;;;
9455;"i asked the lady at the register,""this is the meat on the side??"" she almost looked ashamed and said,""uhh yea";;;;
9456;*there's a photo reference;;;;
9457;needless to say i'm sure once i can eat undercooked meat again i'm sure i'll be back;;;;
9458;just sorta sucked because you pay so much for their food you'd think they'd have larger containers nearby;;;;
9459;plus i know this is a special request;;;;
9460;oh well;;;;
9461;lesson learned;;;;
9462;this is the only old time boot store around;;;;
9463;i walked in there;;;;
9464;i was greeted my a white gentleman in this 50's;;;;
9465;he was very friendly;;;;
9466;he asked me what i was looking for and found me three different pairs of work boots to try on;;;;
9467;he sat me down;;;;
9468;measured my foot;;;;
9469;brought out three different pairs of boots;;;;
9470;laced up my boots;;;;
9471;put my foot in the boots with a shoe horn;;;;
9472;then laced up both boots;;;;
9473;i walked around and decided on a pair;;;;
9474;i thought this kind of service was gone;;;;
9475;red wings is the only boots store that still has service the way it used to be;;;;
9476;this place is awesome!! the white gentleman is awesome!! good prices,great service,well made boots!! i would recommend this place to anyone;;;;
9477;this restaurant was really good & we all had a wonderful dining experience with our large group;;;;
9478;excellent & attentive service fresh & flavorful ingredients nice plating of entrees and walked out of there full & happy;;;;
9479;would definitely go back again;;;;
9480;they are so nice and do such a wonderful job really paying attn;;;;
9481;to detail;;;;
9482;i will drive across town to come here;;;;
9483;i prefer the younger lady for the pedi;;;;
9484;she really takes her time and massages your legs a lot;;;;
9485;my kids took me here for my birthday dinner;;;;
9486;i had the gigantic pork chop and generous helpings of mashed potatoes and rice;;;;
9487;yes i know that's a lot of starch but one of them was a substitute for -- i think -- brussel sprouts which i do not eat;;;;
9488;but it was delicious;;;;
9489;i had been craving a pork chop for months;;;;
9490;thanks harevey's for a great night;;;;
9491;i've been to many of the day clubs in vegas;;;;
9492;hands down encore beach club aka ebc is one of the best day clubs you can go to;;;;
9493;one of the main reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have gaming tables;;;;
9494;most day clubs don't (actually i don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables with the exception of xs but that is a nightclub);;;;
9495;so if you're a gambler like me you're gonna want to go here;;;;
9496;also if you're going to book a table i recommend booking the lilypads;;;;
9497;why? its on the water so you can chill on your lilypad and hang out in the water;;;;
9498;best of both worlds in my opinion! you can't order food from your lilypad but you can order food from the grill and bring it to your lilypad;;;;
9499;so you're good! if you're going to book any tables at ebc make sure you go through a reputable promoter;;;;
9500;i highly recommend booking with the ebc vip host brian pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - his cell phone;;;;
9501;just text him! he is amazzzinnngg;;;;
9502;he will walk you in he will make sure you're all good and he will answer all your questions;;;;
9503;just went to vegas this past weekend and had a blast;;;;
9504;the food was good but not for the price we paid;;;;
9505;it's good for a gas station as well;;;;
9506;the corn was under cooked for sure;;;;
9507;i did like the bbq beans a lot;;;;
9508;i do feel for the amount you spend it should knock your socks off or taste like you cooked it at home;;;;
9509;i do it a 3;;;;
9510;5 but it wouldn't let me do that on the stars;;;;
9511;honestly the looks the girls give my fiancã© and myself when we come in for each appointment is disgusting to feel judged and looked at a certain way for absolutely no reason bugs me to no end they don't know my life they don't know her life they don't know our ages or one single thing about either of us to add on to that we have had 3 reschedules for 2 appointments now 2 reschedules for one single appointment in which we were pushed out one week further and again one week further until they got their stuff figured out and can successfully schedule a consistent appointment schedule we had our first ultrasound today and the woman who did the ultrasound was just an angry woman in which you are putting your trust in to measure and check your babies health and anatomy she was rude to my fiancã© when my fiancã© was asking one simple question she replied with i need to focus right now just let me do these measurements to add to this whole ordeal the environment of this office is just not good at all who watches murder shows on tv with children present in the lobby and blood and gore all over the screen? we were anxiously anticipating an answer on the blood work we did from our last appointment and was not given a single answer and why you ask? because they showed that we missed our appointment to get it done and we were told that we needed to get it done asap well if you guys actually communicated to the lab office and did your paperwork correctly you would have seen that we went in a did do the lab work just as you told us to do so we do our part as parents and are consistent with our things in life don't try to blame us for missing an appointment to get the most important lab work done which was testing for down syndrome and other birth defects would have really loved to know the results to the blood work for our first child;;;;
9512;thanks! one last thing to the girl who has the short black hair at the front desk and the dermal on her neck who keeps giving myself and my fiancã© dirty looks if you don't like what you do then get a different job and quit staring you may be unhappy but don't make everyone's life as miserable as yours all of these reviews speak for themselves i would suggest going somewhere else anywhere else than this place i would avoid this place at all costs save yourself the headaches and anger from the disrespectful girls at the front desk;;;;
9513;this review is not for the food or dining it's only for the reservation & host/management experience;;;;
9514;in short making a reservation means nothing!  i reserved a table for 4 on saturday night at 7;;;;
9515;15pm to welcome my colleagues to a nice meal while staying at the m resort & casino;;;;
9516;it was crowded when we arrived and the host snapped at us saying it would be another 30 minutes for our reservation;;;;
9517;i asked if we could go to the bar while we wait and she said there was no room there either;;;;
9518;so we went to a casino bar & came back 30 minutes later and the manager told us it'd be at least another 30 minutes;;;;
9519;they weren't at all polite they acted like we were being a pain for coming back;;;;
9520;seriously?!  so i asked them to take my number down & call me when the table was ready and she begrudgingly did;;;;
9521;well they never called me to say our table was ready;;;;
9522;good thing we snagged one at the burger & brews place next door;;;;
9523;clearly anthony's doesn't know how to manage their reservations;;;;
9524;obviously an opentable reservation doesn't guarantee you a table;;;;
9525;we were super let down because the menu looks great but i can't comment on that;;;;
9526;the ice cream is great but the owner is very rude;;;;
9527;everytime i go in there she always have something rude to say;;;;
9528;the ice cream gets 5 stars and the owner gets no stars!;;;;
9529;this place impressed me;;;;
9530;it is in kind of a bad location not noticeable from the street on pleasant valley and broadview road however through word-of-mouth i've heard about this place and when i went;;;;
9531;wow;;;;
9532;some of the best sushi i've ever had the chinese food on the menu was much better than 90% of the chinese places in the area;;;;
9533;the quality of the food was exceptional;;;;
9534;i keep on craving this place but just haven't got back yet;;;;
9535;i will be back for sure;;;;
9536;arrived at ~5;;;;
9537;30 and sat outside;;;;
9538;ordered by 5;;;;
9539;then we waited;;;;
9540;and waited;;;;
9541;and waited;;;;
9542;no one checked on us (2 people) until 6;;;;
9543;at that point we asked for our food to go;;;;
9544;got that and the checks at 6;;;;
9545;finally able to pay and leave by 6;;;;
9546;probably some of  the worst service i have received;;;;
9547;at least if you are running behind or food is taking awhile you come back and explain and/or apologize;;;;
9548;instead we were left wondering and waiting for our food;;;;
9549;obviously that never came until we said we were going to leave and take it with us;;;;
9550;you would think at that point they would have apologized or taken something off the check but no nothing;;;;
9551;chances are i won't be back;;;;
9552;that is unfortunate as we spend a lot of time in the area and this would have been a great outdoor spot!;;;;
9553;to top it off when i got home and opened the soggy boxes i was very disappointed at what i paid $11 for;;;;
9554;today was my first time at naked bbq and i can gladly say that it won't be my last;;;;
9555;the chopped brisket sandwich is amazing!! seriously;;;;
9556;you need to try it!!;;;;
9557;wayne was such a great help! he was very well-mannered and took the time to ask how the meal and experience was;;;;
9558;he definitely made the experience better;;;;
9559;the piã¨ce de rã©sistance however had to be the bbq sauce;;;;
9560;it was so good i had to go and buy my own bottle;;;;
9561;i'll be back again real soon!;;;;
9562;i waited almost five months for them to look at my knee;;;;
9563;when i arrived for my appointment there was a line ,so i waited patiently;;;;
9564;when i finally gave the person at the desk my information i was told i i was late for my appointment and would have to be rescheduled the next appointment was six months away;;;;
9565;first,i arrived well before the fifteen minutes requested by them before the actually appointment;;;;
9566;second,i did not appreciate the comment on my cheap government insurance;;;;
9567;it's not my fault i was forced on it;;;;
9568;after reading some of the other horrible reviews i am quite happy i am not one of their patients;;;;
9569;best veggie hoagie i've ever had! way better than going to subway and getting something bland and run of the mill;;;;
9570;very good but a little pricey though;;;;
9571;the fire in the bar area is very cool though;;;;
9572;the food is good;;;;
9573;very nice place;;;;
9574;first time in this place;;;;
9575;pretty impressive;;;;
9576;i liked the lemon popcorn chicken with green onions;;;;
9577;good flavor and sauce;;;;
9578;the soy garlic chicken wings were a little too sweet actually i wish they were a little less sweet and more garlicy;;;;
9579;bimbap was excellent;;;;
9580;delicious and very comforting;;;;
9581;of course all the sides great as usual with korean cuisine;;;;
9582;overall we were pretty happy;;;;
9583;service was good even though i've never been a fan of pressing a button to get the server's attention;;;;
9584;i am not sure where that started but it's a bit  awkward and not very classy;;;;
9585;would come back and have a few other things on the menu;;;;
9586;food is average;;;;
9587;service is mostly good;;;;
9588;tried almost every breakfast plate as well as the burgers;;;;
9589;look elsewhere for good eats;;;;
9590;other than being served pretty cold (through the drive thru) the food wasn't that bad;;;;
9591;would have been way better warm though;;;;
9592;management here is consistently unprofessional and argumentative with customers;;;;
9593;one especially is tyler sims;;;;
9594;we aren't sure;;;;
9595;he hides his name tag;;;;
9596;we've witnessed this with how they have handled others complaints as well our own;;;;
9597;less clean than most other harkins;;;;
9598;it's a newer theatre but it's been run into the ground;;;;
9599;routine disappointment;;;;
9600;we recommend the harkins theatres at park west or arrowhead;;;;
9601;i don't think i've ever had this type of cuisine before what a treat;;;;
9602;got there around 8 and it was packed with indians and hipsters;;;;
9603;the vegetarian dosa is quite good we also the lamb biryani;;;;
9604;had to wait a little for a table but service was fast and friendly;;;;
9605;cozy campus nice building friendly community;;;;
9606;but fundamental sciences (math physics astronomy) do not receive enough attention they deserve;;;;
9607;cmu has an â€‹unexpectedly high bias on its subjects;;;;
9608;too much emphasis on computer science! if cmu thinks big and plans to become a world-renownedâ€‹ engineering school fundamental sciences must be emphasised;;;;
9609;"bought my gear there for years and did so up until the long haired hippy guy looked at me the minute i walked in and said rudely "" take of your backpack and leave it up front""";;;;
9610;seriously really;;;;
9611;the amount of time it takes to take that off and put it on takes forever;;;;
9612;am i really going to shove something into a backpack that's fastened to my back? no other stores have ever asked me to remove my backpack ever specially some hippy long haired ass wipe;;;;
9613;you guys went down hill fast;;;;
9614;never absolutely never will i step one foot inside your store as long as i breath air;;;;
9615;oh and btw i went that day and bought my helmet of decent people azmotorsports;;;;
9616;yeah it was more expensive but they were polite and they actually knew about the products;;;;
9617;perhaps the high turnover in staff is a hint of a deeper lying issue;;;;
9618;keep your bilt crap and your crappy service from long haired hippy morons!;;;;
9619;first time but not our last!! never knew it was there and authentic,friendly staff;;;;
9620;amazing food!!;;;;
9621;ok - we were so sad and bummed when momma mias didn't come back;;;;
9622;it was our go-to pizza place and it killed us! the we found out about this and were sooooo excited;;;;
9623;now normally i think you would want places to be different or unique or doing their own thing but i am so happy that these guys kept to the simple amazing pizza they had before! it was so good and so nice to have something close and back that we love! the wings were great too! delivery was wicked fast!;;;;
9624;guess we will be back to sunday night pizza again;;;;
9625;great little park in the midst of downtown pittsburgh;;;;
9626;a lot of different walking trails food vendors and a nice place to just chill with friends;;;;
9627;our group met up here for a little tour through downtown pittsburgh and it was a convenient initial meeting point to get us started;;;;
9628;there's a great view of the cathedral of pittsburgh from the plaza and some great potential photo's for us tourists;;;;
9629;there's also opportunity to play disc golf here and you'll often see artists university students hipsters families just hanging out in the park;;;;
9630;the only downside is the downtown parking although there is plenty of pay parking surrounding the plaza at $2/hour;;;;
9631;this place is located at the heart of eastern so it's always packed;;;;
9632;food is mediocre;;;;
9633;ordering is very confusing and there was no staff to ask or usher the guests in;;;;
9634;with the music too loud you actually have to shout to the food preparers what you want to order;;;;
9635;pricing was not too bad though;;;;
9636;i was really really disappointed in the staff;;;;
9637;i had gone three times to find a dog and the first two times the dogs i was interested in were adopted which was fine;;;;
9638;so wednesday i called and i asked about one of the dogs and the lady on the phone told it wouldn't be ready till friday;;;;
9639;i rearranged all my plans for friday morning;;;;
9640;they don't open till 11am i get there at 9;;;;
9641;30am;;;;
9642;i was the first in line and waited for an hour and a half;;;;
9643;i was the first person to walk in the door and ask about the dog and she said well we have to wait to see if anyone else would like to see the dog and so of course there was someone else;;;;
9644;mind you- this person shows up 20 minutes before they opened and i waited an hour and a half;;;;
9645;and what happens? they do a raffle and she ends up getting the dog;;;;
9646;they claim they are first come first serve which is not true at all;;;;
9647;false advertising and they really need to stick to what they say;;;;
9648;i will not be returning and i will make sure that i let others know what horrible service i experienced while i was there;;;;
9649;truly unfair and not right;;;;
9650;first time ordering from them the wings are really good and i also got the pig snackers;;;;
9651;the texture of both are amazing just a tad crunchy;;;;
9652;amazing but the fries were waaaaay  waaaaay too salty;;;;
9653;i know they would be the best fries if they had a dash of salt instead of a pale of salt;;;;
9654;besides all that i will def be coming back;;;;
9655;good selection of specialty pizzas;;;;
9656;$18 range on large but very tasty for hand tossed pizza;;;;
9657;since everyone in my family digs tandoori times i've wandered in for eight or nine earlybird dinners and honestly i'm a little underwhelmed;;;;
9658;definitely not bad or awful but maybe if i sandwiched a later supper  between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of kingfishers i'd stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression;;;;
9659;nothing i've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit;;;;
9660;portions tend to be small and sauces are by and large mild and rather one dimensional;;;;
9661;other than the garlic naan i cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by which is a shame considering indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic;;;;
9662;i was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes but a very respectable portion for $10-11) on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers;;;;
9663;the lamb exterior was nice & crusty but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard chewy and disappointing;;;;
9664;companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce that looked more like an appetizer;;;;
9665;chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good and similar to most indian joints;;;;
9666;i recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce green puree and pickled peppers) provided tableside as house preparations at least in my experience tend to be mild;;;;
9667;servers are generally anglo pleasant and competent during the meal but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5;;;;
9668;30 the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence;;;;
9669;nobody's overtly rude but instead of a really warm welcome you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening;;;;
9670;it's not oppressive but it's happened more than once and i'm not crazy about the vibe;;;;
9671;i do like the complimentary self serve chai tea and open kitchen providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit;;;;
9672;nice touches;;;;
9673;the menu is extensive all told about sixty items and reasonably priced for indian food;;;;
9674;indian textiles jewelry and artwork is often on display for sale and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker;;;;
9675;it got turned down eventually but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary american tolerances better than that;;;;
9676;the atmosphere is up and down;;;;
9677;food's ok;;;;
9678;service is ok;;;;
9679;ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars;;;;
9680;in my book tandoori times is just ok;;;;
9681;"before we went to see ""love"" at the mirage my boyfriend and i came in for 7 pm dinner reservations at onda";;;;
9682;we've lived on maui for a few years now and it's almost impossible to get our hands on good italian food;;;;
9683;i came into onda hoping to be wowed and i was not disappointed;;;;
9684;the bar area is small brightly lit and walled with wine cases while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths;;;;
9685;we were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list;;;;
9686;he made recommendations and brought us tastes;;;;
9687;we really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness;;;;
9688;after we ordered wine we started with the meatballs appetizer;;;;
9689;two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce topped with golden crusted goat cheese;;;;
9690;what a perfect way to start our dinner;;;;
9691;this is a must-order;;;;
9692;we also split a caesar salad;;;;
9693;large leaves of romaine not chopped and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons i've ever had;;;;
9694;for our main meal we took our server's suggestion and ordered the burrata agnolotti pasta and the veal osso bucco;;;;
9695;the pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce;;;;
9696;the veal slid off the bone when i used my fork (i barely had to touch my knife at all the veal was so tender) and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible;;;;
9697;needless to say the dinner was incredible;;;;
9698;we ordered the tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean;;;;
9699;earlier during our meal when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order;;;;
9700;each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order so upon request they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can't choose just one;;;;
9701;next time i make it to vegas i'll have to take them up on their offer;;;;
9702;amazing food wonderful service;;;;
9703;you won't be disappointed at onda;;;;
9704;the meal is decent;;;;
9705;we ordered a chicken souvlaki and the chicken was freshly grilled and the potatoes was in good portion;;;;
9706;the greek salad that came with it was a little disappointing;;;;
9707;they didn't even use greek dressing on it;;;;
9708;i think it was just italian or something;;;;
9709;not that great i used some of the tzatziki sauce as dressing;;;;
9710;price is maybe double compared to a mr;;;;
9711;greek on a food court somewhere;;;;
9712;walked out of the place without even being acknowledged by the staff while they were talking with each other;;;;
9713;we were completely ig;;;;
9714;i have been on a quest since moving to arizona to find ny style pizza;;;;
9715;"other places just add ""ny style"" to their storefront but fail to deliver";;;;
9716;i tried 1 slice with xtra cheese and meatballs;;;;
9717;and i literally pictured myself walking in nyc eating a slice of ny pizza;;;;
9718;they delivered on their claim and the service was wonderful! two thumbs way up!;;;;
9719;hmmmm;;;;
9720;well we waited forever to get our food;;;;
9721;not sure if it's any good but after an hour wait on a not so busy day the only activity we saw that was quick was getting our check after we complained about the wait;;;;
9722;what a shame;;;;
9723;doubt i will be back;;;;
9724;service was awful;;;;
9725;still can't believe the manager allowed us to walk out of there without trying to make amends;;;;
9726;i've been in my current house almost 8 years and have had a few issues my ac units;;;;
9727;prior companies gave me the run around and weren't honest or didn't fix my ac's;;;;
9728;found polar air through a friend 3 years ago and have been very satisfied since;;;;
9729;they have always responded quickly anytime of the day;;;;
9730;techs were knowledgable didn't creep my wife out and i never felt over sold on things;;;;
9731;polar air is the best ac company i've found in my 15 years of being a homeowner in the las vegas valley!;;;;
9732;the only reason they're getting 3 stars is for the food;;;;
9733;which is great;;;;
9734;unfortunately nothing beats quality service;;;;
9735;i visited this establishment at least 3 times a week during my lunch for the convenience and good food but was always met with such disrespectful tones and demeanor from the wait staff;;;;
9736;i have been going here for a while so i will say not all of the employees are bad but too bad the only pleasant worker is on the grill !! if you're looking for some great hibachi definitely give this place a try;;;;
9737;just make sure you drop your money grab your food and run! i however have given them enough my money and will not be returning;;;;
9738;i like to get the entire quality experience- food and service !;;;;
9739;the art of steel has an eclectic collection of glass steel tile art knickknacks and gifts;;;;
9740;it's definitely a must-browse store in the strip district and a great place to buy a gift for that hard-to-buy-for friend or relative;;;;
9741;they don't even deserve a single star but their was no other choice;;;;
9742;stay far away from this unethical company if you can avoid it;;;;
9743;the only reason why i've been forced to stay with them this long is because they are the only business internet service provider in boulder city nv;;;;
9744;i'm sorry to say i've been a customer for over 4 years but i'm completely dissatisfied;;;;
9745;they engage in fraudulent bait and switch billing tactics after agreeing to a new two year (lower rate) service agreement my bill has practically doubled instead of going down each month for three consecutive months now;;;;
9746;nothing but a sham;;;;
9747;every time you contact them you get lost in a quagmire of confusion and disinformation and not to mention the worst customer service i've ever seen;;;;
9748;some of these people and i'm talking about management are not able to diffuse an escalating issue and only add more fuel to the fire;;;;
9749;the company needs to be rebuilt from the top on down;;;;
9750;horrible!!!;;;;
9751;not well taken care of anymore;;;;
9752;bathroom dirty;;;;
9753;yogurt stations messy;;;;
9754;we used to love this place;;;;
9755;what happened?;;;;
9756;does not feel clean;;;;
9757;beef plate as well as the chicken were delicious;;;;
9758;the soup was amazing with the freshly brewed tea;;;;
9759;loved this place;;;;
9760;came here it's friends after dinner and had a fine time bonding over quaint and tasty beverages;;;;
9761;liked the service,menu and eccentric furnishings;;;;
9762;its all about the experience and we really had a good one;;;;
9763;will be coming back soon!;;;;
9764;i love this place;;;;
9765;always get the chicken kabob which comes with lentil soup or salad;;;;
9766;delicious!!! a little more expensive than jasmine grill across town but a great alternative when on the east side;;;;
9767;don't interpret the gruff nature of the owner as rude just enjoy your delicious meal;;;;
9768;my tire was low on my way to work one day so i pulled off the highway and pulled into big o tires;;;;
9769;i already called my job to inform them i was going to be late;;;;
9770;as soon as i pulled in ray helped me right away he was extremely attentive and didnt just check the tire that was low he made sure all tires were good;;;;
9771;i dont know if he sensed my urgency but he was so quick and helpful that i wasnt even late to work !;;;;
9772;i've worked with active renter since 2011;;;;
9773;i've referred several of my investor clients to rich;;;;
9774;as a residential realtor its very important that my clients have a great experince with their investment property as i rely on them for repeat business (home sales);;;;
9775;each and every one of my referred clients have been thrilled with the service they receive from active renter;;;;
9776;their fees are typical for the industry and their customer service is top-notch;;;;
9777;when my clients are ready to sell rich refers them back to me for the listing;;;;
9778;he also notifies me of any off-market deals so i can give my investors as opportunity to buy their next rental at a discount;;;;
9779;in addition to referring my investor clients to active renter they also manage my personal rental on 15th ave and northern;;;;
9780;they do a phenomenal job;;;;
9781;they found me a great tenant who takes immaculate care of the property;;;;
9782;the home was built in the 1960s so it has the typical problems you would expect with an older home;;;;
9783;active renter does a good job of responding to my tenants maintenance calls while still keeping my repair costs down;;;;
9784;my tenant is ready to renew their lease for a third year which really helps my cash-flow;;;;
9785;my tenants have even asked if they can purchase the property;;;;
9786;unfortunately with a good property manager in place and a great tenant;;;;
9787;the property is too profitable of an investment for me to sell;;;;
9788;great atmosphere and the owner was super friendly and funny! i had the butter chicken and it was super delicious;;;;
9789;the mango lassi was rich and not too sweet;;;;
9790;definitely would go there again;;;;
9791;my first time tonight - pretty good food;;;;
9792;service lacked but heather saved the night by stepping in and up;;;;
9793;parm fries yum;;;;
9794;green chili pork - meat needed seasoning but put with the tortilla squeeze of lime and pico made it tastier;;;;
9795;will be back to try some of the other menu items;;;;
9796;actually called fresh buy market now;;;;
9797;love this place! best priced produce and asian supplies in the area;;;;
9798;such friendly staff!;;;;
9799;so good;;;;
9800;funghi appetizer ravioli main (pasta is made fresh daily) + glass of rose+ friends+ friendly service= perfection;;;;
9801;super cute/romantic atmosphere;;;;
9802;come here if you're trying to impress on a first date;;;;
9803;come here if you're like me and enjoy wining and dining with good friends;;;;
9804;coming back;;;;
9805;the rail does a lot of things right;;;;
9806;the food is fresh well-priced and tasty;;;;
9807;the restaurant itself is very nice with a bar separating the booths and tables from the patio area;;;;
9808;this makes access to drinks very convenient;;;;
9809;i will say though that the service really hits it out of the park!;;;;
9810;happy hour is great and on top of that they also have a specially priced drink all day for particular days of the week;;;;
9811;for instance long island iced teas are $3 all day on fridays;;;;
9812;honestly the only thing i would change is the a la carte sides;;;;
9813;i think it's unamerican to serve a burger without fries;;;;
9814;keep up the good work rail i love ya;;;;
9815;i have been using this shop for over 5-years and the customer service does not get any better than frank's! his prices are the best and he is always fast i can easily say i do not go anywhere else with my import or domestic truck or cars! thank you frank!;;;;
9816;i had to give them a one star cause there is nothing less then one star;;;;
9817;a group of 9 wanted a nice last meal nothing came even warm to the table after waiting an hour to receive it;;;;
9818;scallops where not even cooked baked potatoe was cold steak was room temperature and after the reviews we wanted lobster mac and cheese there was no lobster in it at all and we had 3 of them;;;;
9819;broccoli raab was a few steamed frozen broccoli crowns that was sent immediate back;;;;
9820;they made 18% gratuity and did a lousy job i'm sitting here writing this as i'm waiting for my check because they are so slow;;;;
9821;go anywhere but here especially if you want a nice meal like we did;;;;
9822;edit;;;;
9823;paul reached out to and all issues were addressed !! thanks paul !;;;;
9824;this review is for the henderson location;;;;
9825;i could have sworn i submitted a review when it happened but it somehow disappeared;;;;
9826;weird;;;;
9827;anyways i heard the vegas location is much better;;;;
9828;/shrug;;;;
9829;i had two cars repaired here at the same time (vandalism damage);;;;
9830;while the actual body work and paint was fine everything else was a total disaster;;;;
9831;one one of the cars a quarter sized dent in the rear quarter panel seemed to have been caused in the shop;;;;
9832;we didn't notice it when we picked up the car at night so we got screwed right there;;;;
9833;the other car was supposed to be in for a week and it ended up taking three;;;;
9834;they ripped off the front splitter and half-assedly screwed it back on without telling me about it and i only realized when one of the employees accidentally spilled the beans;;;;
9835;after we had to go back to have the replaced window tinted (which took them 3 days !) a big scratch was on the trunk lid;;;;
9836;some sort of white residue was all over the car and the seal around the window was sticking up in all sorts of places;;;;
9837;i should have sued them but i was tired of the aggravation;;;;
9838;now somebody rear ended me and guess what the insurance company wants to send me there;;;;
9839;there's not a snowball's chance in hell i ever have them touch any of my cars again;;;;
9840;parking is a little tricky but it's totally worth it for this local gem! i'm a traditional sesame and cream cheese kind of girl but the friendly guy at the counter suggested the pimento blt on asiago and i went for it;;;;
9841;hot and melty and crispy and quite possibly this best bagel sandwich i have ever had;;;;
9842;i want it again tomorrow!;;;;
9843;un des meilleurs endroits dã©couvert ã  ce jour pour savourer un espresso ã  toronto;;;;
9844;le service est impeccable l'endroit est agrã©able mais surtout ils sont maitres dans l'art d'ãªtre barista;;;;
9845;trã¨s agrã©able endroit oã¹ je passe assurã©ment toutes les fois oã¹ je visite toronto;;;;
9846;pinball machines are slowly working their way out of society so i'm glad a place like this exists;;;;
9847;a wonderful and loving tribute to a great past time;;;;
9848;lots of rare unique and long forgotten tables that you can play for the 1st or 100th time;;;;
9849;there's plenty of famous tables (lotr addams family ripley's) that have had color conversions too;;;;
9850;all tables are well cared for and while there's always a handful of tables that are broken they seem to actually fix them;;;;
9851;ample parking and low table prices;;;;
9852;$5 or $10 bucks will get you plenty of play time;;;;
9853;it's not walkable from the strip but a cab or lyft wouldn't be too expensive as you're just to the east;;;;
9854;highly recommended if you have even a passing interest in pinball;;;;
9855;all about blinds & shutters;;;;
9856;they came they measured they installed!! probably the easiest and most satisfying piece of our recent home update;;;;
9857;a great product for a very reasonable cost;;;;
9858;larry & corey are the best at what they do;;;;
9859;played an 18-hole round on a saturday during the mid morning several weeks ago;;;;
9860;the starter got us off on time so that is always a good thing;;;;
9861;the course as mentioned is previously is 27 holes (three 9 hole courses) along with an executive course;;;;
9862;we played red to blue that day;;;;
9863;the course is fairly wide open but there are some tight holes where a well placed drive will be key;;;;
9864;there are some holes with a few blind shots but this is not the norm;;;;
9865;there are some water holes and some well placed bunkers;;;;
9866;overall the course was in really good shape;;;;
9867;tee boxes and greens were well kept;;;;
9868;there are some burnt out patches on the fairways but nothing significant;;;;
9869;my only 'gripe' would be a pace of play;;;;
9870;the course is very crowded and yes i went at the a time where it is even more crowded;;;;
9871;we played in just over 5 hours which is too long but there was really no place to go;;;;
9872;there is no beverage cart service either so it is wise to load up prior to going out or at the turn;;;;
9873;price was a little expensive coming in at $55 for 18 and a cart (weekend rates);;;;
9874;overall i like coming here the course is usually in great condition and the employees are always polite and professional;;;;
9875;had an amazing lunch here a while back! the lineup for this food truck usually isn't as long as some of the other ones and you get your food fairly quickly which is definitely a plus since food trucks are generally supposed to be fast;;;;
9876;i got the dbl (not the combo) for $8 and it was amazing;;;;
9877;the dbl is two pieces of schnitzel with cheese bacon sauerkraut all inside;;;;
9878;especially since i'm not the greatest fan of bread or buns this sandwich/burger was simply perfect;;;;
9879;although the dbl looks small initially it will fill you up for a nice lunch and the schnitzel is done to perfection - not too oily but still very crispy and satisfying;;;;
9880;but be prepared though this isn't a salad or an extremely balanced meal so if you're looking for some greens then it might be better to save this for cheat day;;;;
9881;all last week i was sampling different wing places for the best wings;;;;
9882;and i chose wing time! i came in last week and got a little combo just for myself;;;;
9883;the combo was just what i wanted six pieces of wings with two different flavors;;;;
9884;some blue cheese french fries texas toast;;;;
9885;not to mention a drink! you get a lot;;;;
9886;i did get a little side order of carrots but it wasn't expensive at all;;;;
9887;today we were feeding the wonderful volunteers that are remodeling our church;;;;
9888;they are so kind & generous for devoting their free time to our church;;;;
9889;so i placed an order for the 30 wings special;;;;
9890;i ordered it ahead of time and it was ready when i got there;;;;
9891;everything was there;;;;
9892;and i really like the way that they separated the cold items and put them in a separate bag;;;;
9893;everybody loved the wings including myself;;;;
9894;i will definitely continue coming here either for the lunch special just for myself or if in the future there will be another party i will definitely get their large wings special deal again! i really love their wings! they are perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned;;;;
9895;plus they have the best customer service!;;;;
9896;the security was awful;;;;
9897;my friend was kicked in the back by a group of girls and we were asked to leave;;;;
9898;do not go here;;;;
9899;it is all trash;;;;
9900;apparently this is the first review for this company;;;;
9901;i can't fathom why others have not reveiwed this company;;;;
9902;my 23 year old garage door finally gave up the ghost the other nite;;;;
9903;i got quotes from some competitors ranging from 750;;;;
9904;00 to 1,100;;;;
9905;00 dollars;;;;
9906;both companies came immediately said i needed a new door;;;;
9907;i expressed to them by budget was limited and a new door wasn't in that budget;;;;
9908;a friend said contact aaa action doors;;;;
9909;contacted josh (part owner);;;;
9910;told him my budget was limited;;;;
9911;he came out took one look at the door,;;;;
9912;said we got this it can be repaired w/o question;;;;
9913;all that was needed was new metal bracing along the top and middle;;;;
9914;he installed the metal bracing in less than 45 min;;;;
9915;i had an operating door again;;;;
9916;and saved a bunch of money;;;;
9917;this used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the quality has dropped precipitously;;;;
9918;the food is no longer anything special and the service can be downright hostile;;;;
9919;the last two times we've eaten here our server (older middle-aged woman wearing way too much perfume) was very rude;;;;
9920;most recently she made us wait 10 minutes before she came to our table even though we were the only ones in the restaurant!;;;;
9921;she asked if we wanted menus (who asks that question?) then literally fewer than 3 seconds later asked if we were ready to order;;;;
9922;i could feel the animosity radiating from her;;;;
9923;we tipped less than 10% and this still was overly generous;;;;
9924;i used to be a waiter and have only tipped less than 20% in 2 restaurant visits - this is out of probably thousands of visits;;;;
9925;the food is now bland and tastes like fast food chinese;;;;
9926;even the chicken coconut soup doesn't taste right and that was their best dish;;;;
9927;it's a damn shame;;;;
9928;this used to be one of my favorite restaurants;;;;
9929;i'm guessing it was bought by somebody who simply doesn't care and that attitude is reflected by the staff;;;;
9930;the good ratings here are probably remnants of old visits - i would stay far far away from this restaurant;;;;
9931;an interesting restaurant with a variety of items on the menu;;;;
9932;came here with my dragon boat team for dinner;;;;
9933;quite the busy and huge restaurant located in the old montreal;;;;
9934;seems to be quite popular considering the long line outside;;;;
9935;luckilyâ we had a reservation for 52 guests so we had a private room;;;;
9936;so for that many people 2 staff assigned to our group wasn't enough;;;;
9937;for food i ordered the salmon pizza with arugula;;;;
9938;nice size and quite delicious with a good amount of salmon slices on the pizza;;;;
9939;the pizza crust was nicely prepared;;;;
9940;for $22 its a little bit on the pricier side but was glad i ordered this tasty dish;;;;
9941;for drinks i ordered a pina colada and a beer that's local to quebec;;;;
9942;overall a pretty positive dining experience;;;;
9943;thoroughly enjoyed my food;;;;
9944;staff were friendly and on point with making sure everything was pleasant;;;;
9945;t they have quite the extensive menu here which makes it difficult to chose just 1 item here;;;;
9946;highly recommend this place if you happen to be around the old montreal square;;;;
9947;how do they have people being nominated for mvp when;;;;
9948;1) their team has a losing record? and 2) the same kids do not make the all-star team? coaches kids or something???;;;;
9949;came to this whole foods in search of hot sauce;;;;
9950;in the past other locations have had a fairly decent selection;;;;
9951;this store;;;;
9952;not so much;;;;
9953;they did have the usual assortment of cholula and tobasco but those can be found anywhere;;;;
9954;we chose a new sauce and one we had previously tried and liked;;;;
9955;then we went in search of cheese;;;;
9956;whole foods usually has a great selection of cheeses;;;;
9957;well we didn't find much;;;;
9958;this may have been our fault as we did not walk down every single aisle;;;;
9959;just most of them;;;;
9960;we did see sliced cheeses but not the gourmet ones we hoped to find;;;;
9961;we chose a cashew spread that i tried at a friend's place and got crackers as well;;;;
9962;at the checkout the cashier had a sign posted saying that she is highly allergic to coconuts and to please let her know if what you bought has any derivative of coconuts;;;;
9963;well of the two hot sauces the rice crackers (in a box) and the cashew spread i felt good in saying 'no coconut here';;;;
9964;she scanned the container and proceeded to look at it from every angle turning it over and over;;;;
9965;she asked where the ingredients were listed;;;;
9966;i hadn't looked so i did not know;;;;
9967;she then schooled me on the fact that i would be surprised at how many things contain coconut oil in them;;;;
9968;we paid and went to the car;;;;
9969;i was curious so i found the ingredients;;;;
9970;yep;;;;
9971;contained coconut oil;;;;
9972;i left feeling like i lied to her by not telling her it contained this ingredient;;;;
9973;made me uncomfortable;;;;
9974;if she is that allergic maybe gloves would be an option for her;;;;
9975;but now i know;;;;
9976;i will look at all ingredients if i shop there again or just not go through her line;;;;
9977;wow!  that's all i have to say;;;;
9978;not sure what happened since the last time i was here but it was like going to a completely different restaurant;;;;
9979;horrible rude service from both of the waitresses not just from the one that all the other people here have mentioned--tall nasty and always has a look on her face like someone just took a crap in her cereal;;;;
9980;and i sort of got the impression that because i am gaijin (ie;;;;
9981;not japanese) i may have pissed them off even more;;;;
9982;food still tasted the same (great) but the ambiance and the attitude really really rubbed me the wrong way;;;;
9983;needless to say--no tip;;;;
9984;i would have relished the opportunity that the other reviewer had when tall and nasty followed you out to the parking lot and demanded a tip--i guarantee she wouldn't have found that to be a pleasant experience;;;;
9985;you all just lost a customer and a fan--congratulations nasty face!!!;;;;
9986;jason recommended the penne shrimp dish its was awesome;;;;
9987;definitely request jason as your waiter;;;;
9988;we will be back;;;;
9989;food is amazing fresh yummy;;;;
9990;service is fast and staff is professional and over the top attentive;;;;
9991;austin was amazing for breakfast wait staff breakfast lunch dinner and dessert was 1st class!!!;;;;
9992;ordered a combo burrito very little chicken a lot of beans also come with 8 pieces of chip for 8 dollar not worth it at all i rather go roberto on fort apache much better at anything;;;;
9993;i've been to the ajax location and didn't have the best experience;;;;
9994;i would still give the ajax location another try because maybe i just had them on an off day;;;;
9995;the butter chicken was not creamy and did not have enough sauce in it at all chicken was dry;;;;
9996;this location on the other hand the interior was clean staff were very friendly (not that they werent at the other location) the butter chicken was so delicious! the white meat was well cooked moist on the inside the portion of sauce to meat was perfect and the sauce was seasoned with all of the right ingredients making it so creamy;;;;
9997;i also really enjoyed the chicken poutine;;;;
9998;it had lots of flavour and im a fan of their fries crispy and yummy;;;;
9999;i would go back to this location!;;;;
10000;i went here as a group of 6 friends and our waiter sonia was great and very quick to understand how we paired up to split our meals/receipts;;;;
10001;i tried poutine here for the first time- poutine bom and my friends ordered poutine dynamite which was a bit more spicier with jalapeã±os;;;;
10002;both were good! add a little ketchup on top and it was perfect;;;;
10003;the poutine portions were also large enough to split between 2 people;;;;
10004;great chicago style pizza;;;;
10005;sat outside to enjoy the weather;;;;
10006;very attentive server;;;;
10007;reasonable prices;;;;
10008;je suis allã© ã  quelques reprises aux 3 restos ottavio et je prends toujours les linguines capiccole et poires je n'avais jamais ã©tã© dã©ã§u mais hier sur marcel laurin elles ã©taient ordinaires;;;;
10009;pour le prix 19$  ont-ils changã©s la recette?;;;;
10010;i will for once reserve my words;;;;
10011;get you to this place and check it out yourself!!;;;;
10012;'nuff said;;;;
10013;i love this place! i started my bootcamp workout here 2 weeks ago and already i lost 8lbs;;;;
10014;i bought another weighing scale just to double check lol!! well because i can't believe it! i came almost everyday & i love all the coaches! everyone come here with the same mission & goals so this really help you to keep motivated! the meals plan for weight loss that my coach gave me really worked & i really felt amazing!;;;;
10015;i've been coming here for a little over a year now;;;;
10016;great service and friendly staff;;;;
10017;the salon is run by julie and her sister tammy who are both extremely kind and accommodating;;;;
10018;they're always willing to squeeze you in and  even if they're very busy the wait is never longer than five or ten minutes;;;;
10019;lots of polish colors to choose from (gel and regular);;;;
10020;so happy i found this salon and will be coming back for sure!;;;;
10021;i love chefs mary sue milliken and susan feniger so i was looking forward to experiencing the restaurant during my stay;;;;
10022;the first night we ate at the bar and had a blood orange margarita with a mole rim and the citrus chicken quesadillas;;;;
10023;it was so good i did not want to stop eating but i was stuffed;;;;
10024;on my last day we had lunch there also at the bar;;;;
10025;it was happy hour so the drinks were a little less expensive;;;;
10026;i had the spicy shrimp tacos;;;;
10027;food drink and service are phenomenal;;;;
10028;prices are average;;;;
10029;not overly pricy but not cheap;;;;
10030;you are paying for quality in food and service so just do it;;;;
10031;go there;;;;
10032;eat there;;;;
10033;i've always had amazing service today was nothing short of that free tire rotation and my car ends up dying in the middle of the street in front of their front door;;;;
10034;no jumper cables on my end and the gentlemen marcos and his co worker made sure to help me without hesitation and jump my car;;;;
10035;i appreciate you guys so much and all the hard work you all put in day in and day out;;;;
10036;thanks for saving me today!!;;;;
10037;one of the best pizza places around and ran by great people!! always friendly service!! one of the rare treasures of elyria!! me and my daughter love this place!! if you haven't tried it you should try the pierogi pizza it's delicious!!!!;;;;
10038;i can't believe the service;;;;
10039;so kind patient and reasonable;;;;
10040;the food is even better or just as good as the people;;;;
10041;i come back time and time again and although it may be slow on busy days their attitude and kindness blows me away enough that i dont mind being patient myself;;;;
10042;) always returning!;;;;
10043;"this resto has ""meal of your life"" potential! to start the bread and pesto is to die for";;;;
10044;i ordered the half caesar salad and my loving girlfriend had the half beet salad;;;;
10045;both were nice presentations and incredibly tasty;;;;
10046;for main i had the goat cheese tortelli;;;;
10047;will not lie one of the best meals ever;;;;
10048;the duck confit was cooked to perfection;;;;
10049;very tasty and well worth the price;;;;
10050;gf had lasagna and it was just as good as the tortelli;;;;
10051;highly recommend this place;;;;
10052;will return!;;;;
10053;the three guys that they sent out took about two hours to empty my house and about 1 1/2 to move my stuff into my new house;;;;
10054;very professional the entire time personable and they took impeccable care of my stuff nothing was damaged they wrapped each piece of furniture with pads or plastic;;;;
10055;under $800 for the move and it was so great to not have to do it myself;;;;
10056;i would recommend them to anyone;;;;
10057;i've been buying my tires for all my vehicles from discount tire for years;;;;
10058;i'm always pleased with the products service and customer support;;;;
10059;anyone that is in need of tires i wouldn't go anywhere else;;;;
10060;this is such a fun addition to university circle;;;;
10061;i've been here twice;;;;
10062;both times to watch football games;;;;
10063;there are at least twenty widescreen tvs here;;;;
10064;its two stories with bars and bowling lanes on each floor;;;;
10065;they take reservations and have valet  parking;;;;
10066;both times i got the chicken tenders;;;;
10067;"i wouldn't come here specifically for the food but rather for the ""activity dining"" atmosphere";;;;
10068;bowling for walk ins is 35$ per hr but 50$ per hr for reservations;;;;
10069;the shoe rental is 3$;;;;
10070;the entrees are 10 to 20$ and mixed drinks around 8 to 10$;;;;
10071;this is my go to place to watch big games;;;;
10072;bowling here with a group friends will always make for an enjoyable event;;;;
10073;i waited almost an hour past my appointment (i called in to book ahead) with no apology or explanation;;;;
10074;i've also had these nails (extensions) for a week now and decided they're a bit too long to be functional - called in to ask if they could shorten it and was told it would be $10! will likely not come back because the customer service is seriously lacking and they seem to want to charge you for every bloody little thing;;;;
10075;even their prices aren't so cheap that i can overlook everything else;;;;
10076;not a 5 star hotel but still worth checking out;;;;
10077;you can't beat the location either;;;;
10078;the best pizza in las vegas;;;;
10079;the people working there are nice and polite;;;;
10080;love the place;;;;
10081;very clean place too;;;;
10082;love this place;;;;
10083;good vibe;;;;
10084;friendly staff;;;;
10085;great music;;;;
10086;50 pints;;;;
10087;will definitely come back!;;;;
10088;so far so good;;;;
10089;99 gets  you and a guest in;;;;
10090;the staff is nice and friendly;;;;
10091;this place is way cleaner then the other gyms in the area;;;;
10092;only downside is that this place gets hot;;;;
10093;seems to be a crap ac or something;;;;
10094;but overall the experience is pretty okay;;;;
10095;tip place gets super packed from 5~9;;;;
10096;the crepe is a must try at this store;;;;
10097;the drink is quite sweet including both cold and hot drinks;;;;
10098;the desserts in the cooler are terrible looks nice for instagram pic though;;;;
10099;the owners of this restaurant have another location in charlotte that has been open a very long time and i can't for the life of me figure out why! my husband and i love a good deli and were so excited to see this place so close to home;;;;
10100;the excitement wore off about 5 minutes into the visit;;;;
10101;service was okay but felt like i had to order and get out in record time;;;;
10102;i ordered a ruben and my husband ordered a corned beef sandwich;;;;
10103;they should be ashamed of themselves with the quality of bread and corned beef that they serve;;;;
10104;the cole slaw and potato salad tasted like they bought it packaged from walmart or sam's club;;;;
10105;there is nothing special about this place and i can make a better corned beef brisket at home which isn't saying much;;;;
10106;skip this place;;;;
10107;sadly we still have to wait to get a good new york deli in charlotte and surrounding;;;;
10108;the donuts here were amazing;;;;
10109;this is the donut shop formerly known as presti's;;;;
10110;i won't explain in detail just how good they are because it would just be mean since they are now closed;;;;
10111;i just drove by and called them;;;;
10112;there is no more gillys;;;;
10113;sniff;;;;
10114;pleasant surprise to find a quiznos open even better when i actually had the sandwich;;;;
10115;tasted great;;;;
10116;it's a shame there aren't more quiznos like this one;;;;
10117;awesome truck;;;;
10118;can't wait for brick and mortar location to open;;;;
10119;the nash-vegas hit chicken is the best in the west coast!!!  house pimento is amazing!;;;;
10120;my husband and i stopped in to guitar center on a saturday afternoon in search of a keyboard;;;;
10121;i'm a vocalist but i needed something simple and affordable to help me in my practicing;;;;
10122;when we arrived i saw it was quite busy inside;;;;
10123;employees were very busy running around everywhere to help different customers;;;;
10124;i was actually a little happy about this because i didn't want to be pressured by someone into buying a fancier keyboard than i needed;;;;
10125;we were able to browse the selection try different options and decide on our own;;;;
10126;after making our choice i tracked down an employee at the front desk (tyler) who came and helped us right away;;;;
10127;he asked if we need a power source and i'm thankful he did because that's something i didn't think about;;;;
10128;he tracked down what we needed and checked us out;;;;
10129;he asked if we wanted a warranty and he was able to answer all my questions about it without pressuring me;;;;
10130;tyler was super helpful professional and efficient and i'm thankful he was the one to help us;;;;
10131;we were very satisfied with our experience and will definitely be back to this location for our future music needs!;;;;
